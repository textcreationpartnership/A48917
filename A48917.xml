            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,
      TEI @ Oxford.

         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>BLeeding hearts, you are honour'd to be Baptized, with Chriſts Baptiſme, to pledge your deare Saviour, in his owne Cup. Count not, call not honour miſery. The Wine in your Cup, is red indeed, but with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out dregs to you; Chriſts drinking firſt hath ſweetned it well to Saints. Wrath makes ſufferings, miſery: let the World Houle in their wounds but doe not you complaine: let them curſe as bearing <hi>Caines</hi> marke, but doe you bleſſe God and glory, as bearing the markes of the <hi>Lord Jeſus.</hi> Love in the bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom of a bloudy Cup, and the deeper a man drinkes, the ſweeter. Chriſt powers out love upon the Soule, when the body powers out bloud upon the truth. A Spirit of glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,
<pb facs="tcp:47519:5"/>
is a bleeding Chriſtians glory. There is inward advancement, when outward debaſement. The ſoule is in Heaven, when the body is in Hell for Chriſt. Was that a Dungeon or a Heaven, in which they ſang ſo ſweetly at midnight? Gods dealings are righteous, when Mans dealings are wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed: a man might beare ſuffering upon this ground, that hee hath ſinned; but how ſweetly may they be borne, when ſugar'd with love, and all ſinne forgiven? Yee priſoners of hope: what is your hope? What ſay you of <hi>Englands</hi> night? Will it ever have day? Would my Soule could enter into your ſe<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>crets: Would I could participate with you, in ſome of your Priſon-enlargements. If you finde a Heaven in Hell, what will your Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven be? Now in the Ile of <hi>Patmos,</hi>
               <note n="*" place="margin">A patri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moniis jam ejecti.</note> What ſay's GOD to your ſoules concerning theſe bleeding Jlands?

               <p>God exerciſeth ſtrengthening power, and hee doth it but upon condition of faith, which is as reaſonable and as cheap a condition as can be; but the more rea<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſonable, the worſe, if not obſerved; a mans ſoule ſhall ſinke with a witneſſe, that leans not upon his allowed reliefe.

a likely way to doe well, but whether it ſhall riſe to be as well with the ſoule as 'twas, that reſts wholly upon divine pleaſure; what divine engagement the ſoule can plead for this, would be worth his beſt ſearch.

                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> Finally remember this, that ſtrength<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ening power according to ſenſe and obſervation, comes in by Prayer, fervent Prayer. The Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> found it ſo. Upon ſeeking of God again and again, God made knowne what he was, and
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:47519:22"/>
what he would be to him—<hi>and he anſwer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed me my grace, &amp;c.</hi> That is, to his prayer, God thus anſwered. So the Spouſe ſhee fervently prayes for reliefe, and then in the next Verſe breakes forth as one feeling it. <hi>Stay me with flaggons, comfort me with Aples for I am ſick of love.</hi> Then in the next Verſe you have her ſenſibly expreſſing her enjoyment,<note place="margin">Cant. 2.5.6.</note> 
                  <hi>His left hand is under my head, and his right hand doth embrace me.</hi> God in manifeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of the firſt power, is found un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſought; but in manifeſtation of the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond power he is found as ſought; he ſpeakes to our heart, as we ſpeake to his; he reveales his compaſſion, as we reveale our ſtate. You may want ſtrengthening power if you ſeeke it not. You may live without the lively ſenſe of it long, if you pray not fervent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly. You muſt not diſclaime a good ſtate wholly, becauſe 'tis badly manag'd. Chriſtians ill managing a good ſtate, makes them often conclude 'tis ſtarke naught; this is ill and lies heavy upon the heart, and yet does no good, but much hurt; it diſcourages to prayer and other duties, in and by which comes
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:47519:22"/>
in, the experience of Gods ſtrengthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing power, which they want.</p>
               <p>I have now but one or two things more to ſpeake to the wicked from this point, and ſo I ſhall conclude it. You will never beate the godly out of heart; they have a relieving and ſtrengthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning power comes in ſtill, freſh force from Heaven, they will never be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quered. They are upon a Rock: winds may blow and ſtormes beate, they will never fall; the Rock is foundation, and ſide-props too. Chriſtians are ſtill kept in that hand, that made them Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans; and none can pluck them out of that Hand. The wicked have a great deale of worke, more then they will conſider they muſt quench two ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting burnings ere they will be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>querours; will they doe either? There is an everlaſting fire burning in the hearts of Saints; can all the Waters you power upon it quench it? There is an everlaſting fire burning in Hell; both theſe fires kindled, and maintained by the breath of God; can you ſtop the breath of the Almighty? then may you be conquerors, not before.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="26" facs="tcp:47519:23"/>I would wicked men would be wiſe and acknowledge the principles and pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledges of Saints, and ſtrike ſaile to them. What they are they will be; what they are they ſhall be, to execute the righteous judgement of the Lord upon you <hi>this honour hath all the Saints.</hi> What honour? why? to be borne along re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutely and victoriouſly by everlaſting armes, to <hi>bind Kings with chaines and Nobles with fetters of Iron,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Pſal. 149.8.9.</note> 
                  <hi>to execute the judgement written.</hi> To be reſolute to death is naturall and neceſſary to them becauſe of that relieving and ſtrength<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ening power which workes in them: to be reſolute to their own temporall death, to accompliſh your eternall death; to be reſolute to all hardſhip, to helpe you to your place. The ſpirit of a Lion is in Chriſtians; I would Dogs did know this: 'tis ſtill, 'twill be ſtill main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained ſo, will wicked ſpirits ever be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve this? Ah wicked wretches, the Saints will be Divells to you here; they will rend you and teare you, and never let goe their hold, God ſtrengthens them to it: you might avoid this Hell if you were wiſe, though you cannot,
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:47519:23"/>
that to come. Who would contend with everlaſting burning? with ſuch fiery ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits as can never be quencht? with ſuch men, as are more then men, who have the ſtrength of God, the ſpirit of the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighy working within them? The un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happineſſe of wicked men is double, treble, I know not how manifold; They are liable to the wrath of God and of his people; and have no ſtrengthening, power to ſuccour them. When tortured without, they are more tortured within; 'tis a fattening, hardning, condemning torturing power that workes in wicked ſoules; every drop<note n="*" place="margin">From providence</note> ſcalds, not one cooles their ſoules. The powers which worke mightily in them, are powers of darkeneſſe, and lead to utter darke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe; there I leave theſe, and goe on with my Text.</p>

Why how have you uſed your precious time? you have had many yeeres to fit for this one; many dayes of peace to fit for this day of War; many unbloudy dayes, to fit for this bloudy day.

               <p>The Divell is Almghty in ſome men, I would ſpeake a word to this. That which doth rule all in you, is your Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty; by this you may know what power workes in you. What power is ſupreme in you, the power of light and truth, or the power of darkeneſſe and
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:47519:28"/>

               <p>Enlarge theſe things as you will in your ſelves, I can ſay onely this, you are loſt men, if any thing be Almighty in you, but Chriſt.

               <p>
                  <hi>All might</hi> comes in as all ſinne goes out; the Holy Ghoſt is our power, and hee dwells and workes as hee can get

roome. Let Chriſt have all your af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection, and you ſhall have all his pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, to make you able to doe all that he ſhall call you to. A man is made to du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, as he ſtrongly loves; ſtrong deſires take and make Chriſt, and then Chriſt takes and makes the man ſtrong; as ſtrong as his worke to which hee hath ſuch a deſire.</p>
               <p>God diſpenſeth himſelfe according to his owne will, and yet according to ours too. 'Tis the plague of moſt men, that they deſire but little of God: they are heart-enemies to all power that oppoſes their corrupt affections. The ſtrength of God to mortify what man loves, and God hates, will man ſeeke? or will God give without it? <hi>All might</hi> to overcome all, that overcomes the ſoule, what men deſire or thirſt after (this is talkt of)? therefore they very deſervedly die, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the power of their ſin, and in the weakeneſſe of their ſoules.</p>
               <p>Grace in its meaſure (though not ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to its being) is diſpens'd ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to deſire in its meaſure; for 'tis but a prevenient capacity made by God, to hold ſo much, or ſo much of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe:

Chriſtians enlarge your deſires as Heaven, as the wicked are ſaid to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>large their deſires as Hell. If you would have great things you muſt have great deſires.

               <p>According to affection, and according to <hi>faith</hi> doth the power of God worke in man: Therefore is <hi>Steven</hi> ſaid to be a man full of faith and of the <hi>Holy Ghoſt;</hi> and elſe-where, <hi>full of faith and power,</hi> Acts 6.8.

An Almighty Chriſtian can live and die with an Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty Saviour: Chriſt alone is enough; Chriſt alone is all.

The Sun comes in ſtate in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the great World; it is not up at the Meridian, aſſoone as it appeares in our Horrizon; it riſes and riſes, higher and higher, and ſo filles the great World with glory by degrees; So does the <hi>Sunne of righteouſneſſe</hi> the little World, to wit, man; hee is not at a Meridian height in any mans heart preſently, but gradually; by greater and greater Revelations of power and ſtrength, hee riſes to the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velation of all power that the ſoule is ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable of.

                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> Divine power workes in grace as it works in nature; 'tis Chriſts own compari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon.

As men are deſign'd to Gods Service, ſo God deſignes his power to their ſervice, to worke in and about them. Divine power is Gods immediate agent; man a mediate: power is in the hand of
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:47519:34"/>
God, man in the hand of power, and held up by it, lower or higher, as his worke is—<hi>Whereunto I alſo labour</hi> (ſaith the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle) ſpeaking of his miniſteriall worke) <hi>ſtriving according to his working which worketh in me mightily.

                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> One or two things note, for the right underſtanding of this point. Divine power where it workes loweſt in any Chriſtian, workes above the ruining power of ſinne. <hi>Greater is he that is in you, then he that is in the World,</hi> ſaith Chriſt; greater when leaſt, and where leaſt, then that power which oppoſes him in a

power workes without in the World; but our greateſt worke is to eye and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve how it workes within, in our hearts; I wonder at ſome mens temper, which leaſt of all minde this. The ſoule of man is the nobleſt thing in the World, tis above the world and doeſt thou think that hee which made it ſo above all for himſelfe to work in, is leaſt to be heeded what he works here?</p>
               <p>All paines ſpring from one, that we have ſo little of God: all paines and cares therefore ſhould be turned into one, what have I of God? how might I have more? more of his love, more of his power working in my ſoule?

The power of God workes gradually (ſay I) in the hearts of men; in ſome, much; ſo much that one may ſay they have all might: in others, little; ſo little that one may truly ſay there is not power of God enough un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to ſalvation.

                  <note place="margin">Scrutinu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>.</note>What faith, what love, what joy, what paſſion doth that power make which workes in you? by this you may know whether twill prove a power Divine e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough and ſtrong enough to ſave your ſoules. Yee believe in Chriſt (wee muſt believe this) well: yet this is but one thing; that power which workes this, workes more and further if it worke ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectually unto life. Yee believe in Chriſt; tis well: doe yee love Chriſt too? his word his people, his wayes? How ſtrong is this love? as ſtrong as death? to the death of ſinne and ſelfe? I meane the deniall of both. Remember this one thing for all, power where it works un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to ſalvation, ſtrong enough to ſave a ſinner, it makes ſtrong paſſion, laſting paſſion, and all towards Chriſt and truth. Chriſt is <hi>faire, faireſt, the faireſt of ten thouſand,</hi> that is the faireſt of all; ſo to day, ſo to morrow, ſo every day to the laſt day, <hi>to the end,</hi> as that love which ſet power at work in the heart, is.</p>
               <p>Divine power, when and where it workes unto life, takes the heart firſt;
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:47519:37"/>
there it begins. A man loves aſſoone as he lives, Chriſt, truth, whatſoever is ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly. There is a deſire of milke, <hi>yea ſincere milke, in new borne babes;</hi> in babes aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoone as berne there is love; love to truth, love to pure and ſincere truth, to the pure and Holy word and wayes of God: there is even in babes <hi>deſire; Divine affection;</hi> panting after that light which came downe from Heaven: O what is truth? what is Chriſt? would I know him; would I could enjoy him: <hi>Firſt faith</hi> is moſt indiſcernable; <hi>firſt love,</hi> which workes from it, is moſt diſcer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable, tis ſo ſtrong and pure, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I moſt mention this paſſion in this caſe, to diſcover the power that workes in you.</p>
               <p>Divine power makes a divine nature where it workes to ſalvation; a man is another Creature in deſire then what he was; hee ſenſibly differs from himſelfe in affection. Things momentanie are fallen two, yea, ten in the hundred with him; they have loſt their price. The heart hath ſold all for nothing, that was all once unto it. <hi>Gold, Dung;</hi> learning dung; all loſſe and dung; <hi>ſtinking</hi> earth,
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:47519:38"/>
that way taking. The heart thirſts for nothing, but him that is all; all power, all love, all holineſſe, all happineſſe. Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine power where it workes ſtrong en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ough to ſave, makes paſſion divine, all paſſions, love, joy, feare, hatred. I doubt much what power workes in ſome mens hearts, I ſee their affections ſo ſtrong and ſo hearty to the World and the vanities of it: I ſee paſſion ſo impure and ſo ſtrongly working downward. Chriſt and truth but as a ſtraw when it lies in the way of the mans luſt; hee leapes over it with eaſe to ſatisfy his deſire, I like not the ſtate of that mans heart.</p>
               <p>Power is leading where tis ſaving; it leades by truth; by the heart. <hi>I am thine ſave mee.</hi> Saith the <hi>Pſalmiſt. Thine,</hi> that is, thine according to truth; thine in heart, thine in life: thine in truſt; thine in bloud, in Chriſts bloud, I leane on none elſe to ſave me; I leane to none elſe to guid me.</p>
               <p>Power is killing, that is ſaving; ſin-killing that is ſoule-ſaving. The body of death, dead: the body of death, no body; no body with a ſoule, with life. Selfe-will ſlaine; the will that lives,
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:47519:38"/>
Chriſts. Not I live, Chriſt lives in mee. <hi>(i)</hi> not my will, but Chriſts will carries and ſwayes the ſoule. Theſe things have beene ſaid to try you, what power and grace of God is in you, I ſhall ſay a little more in the next place to ſtir you, to acknowledge grace as you finde it, and ſo leave this point and you for this time.</p>
               <p>Divine power workes gradually; why as you finde God working in you ſo ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge him; Let God have his own to a graine. <hi>Thine is the Kingdome and power, &amp;c.</hi> Wee are taught this to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge grace in its latitude, to the God of all grace.

               <p>Doe but conſider ſome poore ſoules that ſit by you, which have no power of God ſtirring in them, but lie dead, damnably dead, and then bee you dead if you can, to give thanks for that power which hath quickned and raiſed you from the dead; God will turne grace into our glory hereafter, we ſhould turne grace into his glory here.</p>

                     <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>Is as it ought to be, when apprehenſion makes full and due impreſſion upon affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on:</hi> When the ſoule workes out for God in deſire and Prayer, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding as it apprehends the neede of him; the neceſſity of his power, love, or the like, for himſelfe or others. Suitable to what the Apoſtle apprehended, he pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed:
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:47519:41"/>
ſuitable to what hee judged theſe would neede of GOD, of his Power and might, ſo hee heartily wiſhed to them.</p>
               <p>Apprehenſion is placed ſentinell in the ſoule by God, the actions of it ſhould ſtirre all. It's a power in man to ſee at a diſtance, and to give warning to all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther powers, that the heart may more looke out, and worke out according to what is or will be needed.</p>
               <p>God is come within ſight of man, when apprehenſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> reacheth him. Accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to what of God is in ſight, ſo ſhould the ſoule ſtir. <hi>I have heard of thee by the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring of the eare, but now mine eye ſeeth thee, I abhorre my ſelfe in duſt and aſhes and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent, Job.</hi> 42.5, 6. Whil'ſt <hi>Iob</hi> had not ſuch an apprehenſion of Divine power as it was, the leſſe ſinfull that his ſoule did not ſtir in reference to it as he ought, but aſſoone as hee rightly underſtood it, all other powers ſtirr'd thoroughly, and <hi>Iob</hi> anſwerably repented and went about his buſineſſe to ſtoop to that pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er which he ſaw above him.</p>
               <p>Every faculty muſt have the honour of its place; Divine Ordination muſt
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:47519:41"/>
have the honour of its end or the man dies for it. <hi>When you ſee theſe things ſay that winter is neare, &amp;c.</hi> Saith the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. That is, make uſe of what you ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend, and anſwerably ſtir and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare or you wil periſh with the world. So you ſhall have expreſſions frequent, when you heare this or that then doe thus and thus. That is, when one faculty does its Office let all the reſt doe ſo too, or elſe you are loſt men. If any ſentinell ſhoot off and be not regarded, the whole army dies for it.</p>
               <p>Any ſoule-power miſworking over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throwes all; ſo any ſoule-power diſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beyed in working by other powers, o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verthrowes all. If apprehenſion bee blinde and ſleepy the ſoule is undon; If apprehen ſin ſee and ſpeake in and by conſcience, and yet the heart lie ſtill, all will miſcarry by ſurpriſe. Apprehenſion is a power placed to prevent ſurpriſe; Sad things concerning man, by Divine Ordination, worke at a diſtance for a time; that man has his <hi>eyes in his head</hi> that ſees this ſaith <hi>Solomon:</hi> that is, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſion diſcharges its office, if this Office, and power bee ſleighted by o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:47519:42" rendition="simple:additions"/>
powers in the heart, all is taken by ſurpriſe.</p>
               <p>I thinke apprehenſion now, does its Office in moſt of you, how is it obeyed in heart, in other maine powers of the ſoule? Surely now no man but muſt needs apprehend, that hee may want much of God ſpeedily, as much as the Apoſtle apprehended theſe might doe, much might, all might: now what ſtir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring of heart under all that you appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend? yee are convinced; are yee con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted? Doe yee ſtir now for your ſelves as the Apoſtle did for theſe? Doe yee wreſtle hard with God for all that yee apprehend, yee may need? Can yee ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend the neceſſity of much and be ſtirr'd little? Can yee ſee bloud and death in the Land and lay nothing to heart? Can'ſt thou ſee better bloud then thine own ſhed, and yet make no preparati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on for the loſſe of thine. Though many be ſlaine yet ſhall not I: ah Lord! that ſoule is ſlaine already; 'twill be wofull when that body comes to be ſlain too.</p>
               <p>Doſt thou ſee a Sword in the land ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rating between ſoule &amp; body, and doeſt thou not yet ſet to ſeparate between ſin
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:47519:42"/>
and thy ſoule? Art thou reſolved to die in thy ſinne? wilt thou bleed to death in thy ſinne? this will make every drop of bloud that comes from thee as gaſtly as Hell. What a deadly bleeding is that, when ſoule and body bleed to death together? when the ſoule bleeds as faſt with wounds from conſcience, as the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy with wounds from man. When ſoule and body bleed mortally together, ah Lord! let mee not be neere that man: how will hee ſigh? how will hee looke, ſpeak, gaſpe and groan? and yet many ſuch ſad ſights may be for ought I can diſcerne, in many mens preparations to this houre.</p>
               <p>Sinners, God deales with you now as with <hi>Balaam,</hi> he ſtands before you with a drawen ſword, hee threatens your bloud, your death if yee make a ſtep further; yee cannot but apprehend this now as well as I; <hi>Balaam</hi> and his Aſſe too muſt needs ſee it now. What now will yee doe? will yee make no uſe of ſuch pal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable apprehenſion? How exceeding ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full wil that ſin become which rids it out now againſt bloud and death, and will live when the man muſt no longer live.
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:47519:43"/>
I beſeech you all conſider the dealings of God, and conſider your eternall ſtate. Chriſtians what doe yee ſee? what doe yee doe? yee ſee bloud, good bloud, a great deale of good bloud fall, does good bloud ſtir in you? You ſee death moſt deadly comming towards you, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the point of a mercileſſe ſword, as mercileſſe I dare ſay you Londoners ſhall finde it if it prevaile, as ever was drawn, doe yee fit and prepare for it? to be hewed to pieces, drag'd to death, trod to death under Horſe-feet? yee cannot but apprehend that things may goe very bad, and that yee may need very much ſpeedily; does apprehenſion make due impreſſion? Doe yee worke out Heaven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, as the Apoſtle doth here anſwer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to what yee apprehend you and yours may want?</p>
               <p>Sinne is in great power where the ſoule will not give up, when he ſees God comming againſt him. Thy love to ſin will be an everlaſting love, that dies not to ſinne now; thou and it will goe to Hell together. Affection to evill be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes <hi>Almighty,</hi> unconquerable, and there is no way but one with the man. Man
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:47519:43"/>
muſt die or his ſinne, that juſtice is at worke which will kill one or tother. I bleed and mourne to ſee how ſome men ſinne in the face of Juſtice, at ſwords point; ſweare, curſe, and drinke drunk and yet going about deadly workes. I ſee plainly now, that a man may ſee mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſery and yet not ſeeke out to be bleſſed; hee may ſee himſelfe and others very open to and very neere upon deadly danger, and yet neither ſeeke out for himſelfe nor others; why elſe doe we ſee ſo many continue ſtill yet as they were? <hi>Pauls</hi> ſpirit ſurely is few mens happineſſe to ſtir effectually towards God as they apprehend juſt cauſe.</p>
               <p>Apprehenſion workes divinely upon <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> affection, as it keepes it ſelfe pure from unbeliefe, and no otherwiſe. Unbeliefe is full of ſhift and evaſion, the life of ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſion dies in this. Apprehenſion made from the Word of God, or works of God, workes no longer nor no ſtron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, then as faith workes with it. Why doe ſuch mighty apprehenſions as wee raiſe ſometimes by the word, die and come to nothing, but becauſe faith dies? men believe but whilſt they ſee us and
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:47519:44"/>
heare us ſpeake. Keepe faith alive, you will elſe ſee Hell often and feele it too and yet doe nothing to ſhun it. Yee will ſee miſery and yet not prepare for it, yea, yee will ſee judgement at the doore and yet ſcoffe at it; ſo did they of the old World; and another old World is this.</p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> Apprehenſion workes divinely upon the heart as the will is ſubdued. A ſtub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>borne man fights againſt all apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion he does not like; he ſhootes at God a great way off, and kills him before he can come neere the heart, to doe any good there. <hi>I will not heare him ſay's</hi> Ahab, <hi>hee never propheſis good to mee.</hi> A ſtubborn heart does prejudge, kill things before they can come neere him. Apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions worke as wee manage them; the ſtrongeſt are quickly kill'd if wee fight againſt them, the trueſt quickely made deluſive if an unſound heart be in us.</p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> Apprehenſions are beſt and worke beſt, as they come from God and are carried to God. Some apprehenſions a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſe from Satan and his temptations, theſe often worke ſtrongly, but run the ſoule ſtill againſt ſome truth, and off ſome
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:47519:44"/>
duty. That truth which is jaſſel'd a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt muſt diſcover ſuch apprehenſion to bee temptation and ſet the ſoule in againe. A man muſt fight againſt appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſion as it fights againſt Gods Will, and takes us off from our duty. A man muſt not make apprehenſion from ficti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on as ſome tempted ſoules are taken up this way, but from reall words or works of God, theſe are onely of ſanctifying power upon the ſpirit. And yet theſe which riſe well, muſt be kept up well, or elſe theſe will be powerleſſe too. A man much in apprehenſion muſt bee much in Prayer, things will die elſe in the braine as they ly, and derive no influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence downe upon the heart. God muſt heare much of what we ſee, or elſe our viſion will not be glorious; taking, fiill<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and leading the heart. Divine ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſions are Gods joggings of man, and man muſt jogge God againe often to underſtand them well, and to uſe them well, to know fully what God would to us in them, and what we ſhould be to him by them. Apprehenſions come in confuſed, and are ſhap'd and made plaine by Prayer; as they come from
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:47519:45"/>
God they are ofttimes above us; as car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried back againe to God by Prayer, they are made plaine and eaſie to us, and very effectuall upon us. I judge theſe things very ſweete to ſome of you, but I doubt they are very uſeleſſe to many, they doe ſo little lay their Eye or Eare to Gods Word or Worke, ſo little buſie apprehenſion about any thing that is Divine. Apprehenſion workes much (I believe) this yeare, but (I doubt) not very Divinely if it did ſurely we ſhould ſee better hearts and lives then we doe.</p>

               </p>
               <p>This is ſpoken in the generall. I would have every one of you in particular, to take notice what power works in and by you and call it as it works. Are yee ſelfe-condemned? call that a convincing power. Are your hearts prickt and woun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded? call that a terrible power. Are your hearts inflam'd with love to Chriſt? call that <hi>a glorious power.</hi> Divine power con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demning, executing, to wit, torturing, muſt be look't to betimes. 'Tis time to ſhake off ſin, when hell is come home; come into a mans ſoule, ere the ſoule be gon out of the body. A power working meerly convictive, is a ſad and black, not a glorious power. Such a man ſhould know that life and death are neere him: he may live or he may die, as he ſtoopes to that power which hath ſeis'd upon his ſoule. Where power works meerely con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>victive, that man is endited for his life; if he can believe he will doe well; if not
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:47519:51"/>
his wounds will bleed to death. No pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er workes ſo black and ſad in the ſoule, but faith alters it and makes it a glorious power. The goings of God in the ſoule are ſuited to faith ſtill. Believe O ſelfe condemned ſoule and thou ſhall ſee the glory of God; a glorious power work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in thee. Out of faith, ſprings love; out of love, Heaven; Heaven felt, and then, and not till then, a Chriſtian calles the power that workes in him a glorious power: all is glorious, in Heaven. The ſoule quickly calles power as it feeles it worke, and very hardly otherwiſe. Wee call the Sun glorious, when we ſee it and feele it, ſmiling, warming, &amp; <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

Power is glorious, and confeſſed glorious, as it does it's moſt glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious works in the heart. Chriſtians yee are too far from Heaven, to call the Sun glorious: too few glorious works in you, to call power glorious.

                  <pb n="85" facs="tcp:47519:52"/>Tis an expreſſion of energy and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine force, moulded and ſhaped with ſuch glittering letters and words, with ſuch varniſh and beauty from Heaven as to take and carry every heart thither. Words of glory, and workes of glory, all things of glory, are of great power and force with fallen man; in a glorious ſtile therefore doth the Holy Ghoſt here ſpeake.—<hi>according to the power of his glory.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Holy Ghoſt doth ſpeake as like himſelfe, and to man as like himſelfe. Hee ſpeakes as one in Heaven, as one wrapt up in God and in glory, to whom the language of the holy Land is natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall: and he ſpeakes to man as on earth, in earth, wrapt up ſoule and body in earth; cold, dull, heavy, and hard to be lifted up to Heaven, unleſſe Heaven and glory be brought to his doore, to his eye and eare, if anything be of power and force upon a dead creature this will—<hi>according to the force or power of his glory.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>God ſpeakes to man, as man yet moves according to the ruines and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mainders of his firſt ſtate. Mans firſt ſtate
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:47519:53"/>
was glory, and he is a creature leaning and ſtrugling that way ſtill, to get and make a ſtate of glory; he gropes after it in every thing, and as any thing carries glory and luſtre to any ſenſe, eye or eare, ſo hee lookes after it and heark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ens to it. Things of naturall glory, of glory to the ſenſe, they are very ſwaying with a broken glorious creature. This the Divell knowes right well, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore hee beſpangles his expreſſion with Heaven, and glory, and the ſtate of a God, when he has to doe with man. So he did to the firſt <hi>Adam,</hi> ſo he did to the ſecond <hi>Adam,</hi> hee ſhewed him all the Kingdomes of the World and the <hi>glory</hi> of them ſaith the Text; he knowes words and works inlaied with glory, are very working and winning upon humane na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, who ever weare it. Therefore doth he at this day gild all his deadly pils, and makes them golden and glorious things to looke upon; and daily workes in his beſt apparrell <hi>as an Angel of light;</hi> he puts faire white ſleeves upon his arms when he is going to butcher the ſoule; he makes every toole and inſtrument of death looke as glittering and as glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:47519:53"/>
as may be, hee hath had long ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience that golden glorious things are of great force, upon a broken glorious Creature. As Satan doth ſpeake and worke towards man, as man moves ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the remainders of his firſt ſtate; ſo doth God. Hee knowes that fallen man is much leaning and grope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing after glory, and therefore ſhall yee finde the Holy Ghoſt ſo leaning to this way of ſpeaking in the word, and work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in the World, namely, to cloath expreſſion with words of glory, and actions, with workes of varniſh and glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry. As when Chriſt was to come in the fleſh, and ſent his Herauld's to the Shep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ards, <hi>The glory of the Lord ſhined round about them</hi> ſaith the Text. Man is taken with a ſurrounding glory; once he had ſuch a glory; in Chriſt he was to have it againe: therefore came the meſſage ſo viſibly, and ſo ſtrongly inſtructing this way. Glory to any ſenſe workes mightily, and be but glory to the eare, glorious words; but glory round, to eare to eye, to many ſenſes at once, this makes Heaven, and carries all before it, ſwallowes up the ſoule. So when
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:47519:54"/>
Chriſt ſhall appeare againe, you have the Holy Ghoſt telling man, that he ſhall <hi>appeare in glory.</hi> The Holy Ghoſt knowes that man is a creature much taken with glory, therefore doth he cloath his acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and words with glory.—according to his <hi>glorious power.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>God ſpeakes to man as to a creature of ſtate. Perſons of ſtate and majeſty mind glory as their neereſt kinſ-man, and take in things onely as they come in glory, and cannot ſtoop to owne and embrace any elſe; as Kings and perſons of ſtate can embrace nothing but what comes in ſtate, and preſented with glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, ſuitable to their majeſty. Man is a creature of ſtate; of a big ſpirit; of a very big ſpirit in a very bad ſenſe: words muſt be big when the ſpirit is big, or elſe they will not beare down all be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore them. One ſpirit ſpeakes high and loftily to another: man will not open the everlaſting-doores unleſſe the King ſpeake, and ſpeake as a King, in ſtate, in glory, and therefore doth he ſo ſpeake —according to [<hi>his glorious power.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Holy Ghoſt ſpeakes ſo to man, as to make man know his diſtance; he
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:47519:54"/>
ſo, as to make him know him that ſpeakes to be God, and him that is ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken to, but man: God ſpeakes ſo as to make man admire, tremble, ſtoop. Man is a creature conceited, and yet of no reach: his conceptions and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions leſſen the dimenſions of God, his wiſdome, his power and the like, and in this way man growes upon God by ſinfull boldneſſe; and therefore God is faine to put titles and epithites upon his things himſelfe; to name things ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to their nature himſelfe, which fallen man could have done once, but now cannot; to call love, — <hi>Love paſſing knowledge:</hi> and wiſdome, <hi>infinite: his wiſdome is infinite</hi> ſaith the Pſalmiſt: and power, <hi>glorious</hi>
                  <note n="*" place="margin">To call an Angel, an Angell: and gold, gold.</note>: he is faine to cloath every attribute himſelfe with royall ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parell, with titles ſuitable, that ſo man may know and keepe his diſtance; heare and feare: heare and admire: heare and ſtoop to him that is ſo glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous and ſo far above him in every Limb; that hath ſuch a glorious Arme —<hi>glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous power.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Finally God ſhapes expreſſion ſo to man, as to hint him of, and move him
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:47519:55"/>
to, his higheſt ſtate, He fetches expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion from Heaven and from glory, to minde man what ſhould take him up, and whither hee ſhould drive in all hee ſayes and does: he goes before man in glory, to draw man after him, he ſpeakes gloriouſly to man, that man may eccho to him, and call divine power as hee does, and be taken with divine power as he is; that man may looke about, and turne away his eye from things that are vaine-glorious, to that which is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed glorious, and will indeed make man ſo, being ſtrengthened with it.

               <p>To unſtir'd ſoules I muſt firſt ſpeake from this point, certainly you are dead. This <hi>is</hi> the firſt principle that ſprings from this point. Unſtir'd ſoules are dead ſoules; he that ſpeakes, ſpeakes ſo glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riouſly ſo movingly, that all men un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe they be dead muſt needs be ſtirr'd. Were your ſoules alive the words of Chriſt are ſo ſweete, ſo full of glory and divine force, that they muſt needs ſtir and take you: were you but aſleepe the words of Chriſt are ſo glorious and ſo ſhining in your eyes that they would awake you. Tis a remarkeable place to this purpoſe <hi>Cant.</hi> 7.9.— <hi>and the roofe of thy mouth like the beſt Wine that goes down ſweetely, cauſing thoſe that are aſleepe to ſpeake.</hi> Chriſts glorious words are very taking, they goe down <hi>ſweetely;</hi> if there be any principle of life in the ſoule twill ſtir it: If the heart be aſleepe in the lap of any lower ſweete, in the lap of any low delights, if onely aſleepe, and
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:47519:56"/>
not dead in the neſt, this higher ſweete and glory, will awaken it, and make it ſpeake to the praiſe of him that ſo ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds all, in ſweetneſſe and love. <hi>Solomon</hi> was aſleepe for a while in the lap of low delights; but when once Chriſt began to ſpeake in a glorious ſtile to his ſleepy ſoule, hee awoke preſently, and made ſonges of that glory, that tranſcendent glory which he ſaw. Surely therefore I conclude that they are dead men whom words of glory, words full of Heaven cannot ſtir.</p>
               <p>How glorious the expreſſion of Chriſt is here, yee heare: how gloriouſly Chriſt hath ſpoken upon it, out of the mouth of a babe, out of the mouth of <hi>a Worme and no man,</hi> yee have likewiſe heard: of what force and power all hath been upon your hearts yee know: how much more in love with Heaven and with the Word of Chriſt, and how much leſſe in love with the World and with your luſts then you were, you know; yee that yet are as yee were, not a jot better, ſurely yee are dead: yee that are yet dead, ah Lord! when when will yee bee alive? Let every heart attend,

This man hath the plague in his heart, and hath ſhut up himſelfe that none may come at him, no not the King of glory, not words of glory: write <hi>Lord have mercy, upon this mans doore,</hi> upon his forehead, for he will die in his ſinne, all the World cannot ſave him. Whom truth cannot ſtir, nothing can; whom glorious words of truth cannot ſtir, nothing ſhall; the man is ſtretcht out for dead, I am now ringing his knell, does any dead ſoule heare me?</p>
               <p>A Scepter of gold, a glorious power <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> held out gloriouſly, the God of glory ſpeaking in glory, and yet the heart of man not taken nor ſtir'd, ah Lord! this heart is taken already; this heart is cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly catcht with ſome fading glory.

Were there any ſoule at home when the King of glory, and the King in glory knocks, certainly 'twould open.

<pb n="95" facs="tcp:47519:57"/>
with that power that ſends you to Hell? Surely glorious power gloriouſly ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed will take your ſoules, or deſtroy them. In what ſtile God ſpeakes, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to it will he make operation in every man, upward or downward.

               <p>God ſpeakes gloriouſly to take, affect, and ſave the moſt obdurate heart, let him have his deſigne; this is the laſt thing that I would preſſe upon you, and this concernes us all. God makes his words glorious, his workes glorious, that the heart may be melted and moulded to a glorious forme by them, doe not fru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate divine art.

Power, and Love, and Wiſdome, they are ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cented and aſpirated; <hi>glorious power, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite wiſdome, love, paſſing knowledge, &amp;c.</hi> Theſe titles and aſpirations, this duſt of gold muſt not be throwen away, but adde to the impreſſion of truth; for 'tis God ſetting all his ſtrength, to thruſt things into the heart; 'tis God uſing his beſt ſoule-ſaving art, to get into <hi>Sanctum ſanctorum.</hi> As the heart behaves it ſelfe, ſo Divine truth lives or dies in it; as Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine words, die or live in the heart, ſo God dies or lives in the World. Much of God dies, when glorious expreſſions make not glorious impreſſions: much God-dying makes much man dying: that God is ſo much dead in <hi>England,</hi> makes ſo many men dead. Man is leſſe then a tittle of truth; yea, the World is

               <p>The goodneſſe of the heart is, as the words of God make totall impreſſion upon it. Tis the beſt heart in which God can beſt read all that hee hath ſaid to a tittle; and finde glorious impreſſions, ſuitable to the glorious words, in which he deliver'd himſelfe. How you judge of your hearts I know not, God judges of them, as your breath turnes into his; as your ſpirits admire, adore, riſe and aſcend into Heaven with his. That heart which can reade and heare glorious words of Chriſt and not be anſwerably affected, will never be a glorious Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian. Chriſt makes the place of his feet glorious; as he treades in the heart, ſo hee makes it glorious; as his Word
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:47519:59" rendition="simple:additions"/>
makes impreſſion, ſo is ſanctification and no otherwiſe: they that heare and let goe divine words of the the movingſt forme and force, will certainly die looſe Soules.</p>
               <p>Men goe to reading and hearing the word with a careleſſe ſpirit, 'tis moſt mens ſinne; all that ſuch get is judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: <hi>they eate and drinke judgement</hi> ſaith the Apoſtle reſpecting another Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance. So theſe heare and reade judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to their ſoules, that is, heart hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning and not heart raiſing. The hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling of ſuch a glorious expreſſion as this (though by a weake ſervant of Chriſt) muſt needs have ſet your hearts ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing more Heaven-ward, had yee heard with ſuch preparation as becomes you. A man finds God in his Word, as hee ſeekes him in Prayer and no otherwiſe. Wax receives impreſſion as 'tis prepar'd? <hi>Eſther</hi> muſt faſt and pray, and come with her life in her hand to the King, to have a glorious Scepter ſtretched out unto her. So muſt we come into the preſence of the King of Kings, with much ſeeking of God and ſelfe-judging: with our lives temporall and eternall in our hands,
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:47519:60" rendition="simple:additions"/>
to finde glorious words worke glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riouſly; to have a glorious Scepter ſtretched out from Heaven to us; a glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious power working in us, in the hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring of glorious things. Hee that minds little about what he is going, finds little but the fruit of his ſinne; he goes away from divine ordinances worſe then hee came to them; he goes away with a ſop; with a heart more poyſoned in malice; more hard, dead and cold; condemned and executed, to wit, tortur'd.</p>
               <p>I conclude this point with a note of admiration. That God will put gloſſe upon neceſſary commodities, ſuch as we cannot be without and doe well, to make them off, is wonderfull. Yee doe not uſe to put varniſh upon Bread; that's ſuch a generall neceſſary diſh, that its double and maine uſe to the ſtate of man, ſets it off well enough, without any by-things about the diſh; Such is the Word of God; 'tis as bread to our ſoules; of ſupreme uſe; this, one would think, ſhould be enough to ſet it off with us; and yet becauſe this is not; God paints bread; guilds Loves and ſets them up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Table to us.<note n="*" place="margin">Puts gloſſe up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the words of eternall life.</note> That GOD will
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:47519:60"/>
put himſelfe into a paſſion, to put us, put Heaven into his words, to put Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven into our hearts; lets wonder. That Chriſt will let fall his mantle when hee aſcends, that we may aſcend too; make his raiſed ſpirit, breake forth into glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious raiſed words, to raiſe our ſpirits too! let his love and humility be ever before you.</p>
               <p>'Tis our great worke, Chriſtians, 'tis our great worke, to admire God in his words and workes, in his ſpeaking and doing, how hee does ſhape all to a gai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning and ſaving end of loſt man.—<hi>Glo<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>rious power;</hi> how big-bellied with Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven are theſe words? what a tranſcendent ſhape have they, to ſave!

Chriſt hath a Kingdome and a throne here, as well as above, and Kingdomes and thrones muſt not onely have power <hi>ſimplicitèr,</hi> but power <hi>orna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tè,</hi> not onely a power which is abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely neceſſary to uphold the being of ſuch a thing, but power alſo to adorne, dignify, and felicitate ſuch a being up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>held.

               <p>Power workes in Order to expreſſe <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> words, and to types and ſhadowes; it doth in the new houſe, as it did in the Old, and more. They had preſence; filling preſence, glorious filling preſence. The glory of the Lord filled that houſe, ſo doth this; power workes thus ſtill; preſence, filling preſence and glorious filling preſence; There is grace, riches of grace, and exceeding riches; an inhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritance, riches of inheritance, and riches of glory, and all in the Saints.— <hi>That you may know what is the hope of his calling, and what the riches of the glory, of his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heritance in the Saints.

Power workes and will
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:47519:64"/>
worke ſtill more and more glorious within and without as the Chriſtian world drawes nearer and nearer full glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, as all things worke ſtronge ſtneareſt their ſpring and riſe. Power workes glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riouſly now, but it will worke far more gloriouſly every day then other; the Moone will become a Sun, and the Sun ſeven fold more glorious then now it is.</p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> Power workes in order to its own ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolute nature. Nothing is too hard for Divine power; it will worke like it ſelfe in any thing; in any ſubject, in any place, under any diſadvantage; 'twill make barren joyfull, baniſhed joyfull, 'twill make Heaven in a furnace, Heaven in hell, <hi>Steven</hi> found it ſo; 'twill worke gloriouſly in Heaven, 'twill worke glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riouſly in earth, in duſt; 'twill worke gloriouſly in man, in beaſt, in any crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture; 'twill make man allmighty wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, children, any as it liſts: Its abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute, and workes ſo; it can doe any thing and doth ſo; it can worke glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riouſly in a dunghill, and workes as it can; puts forth according to its ſupream, and glorious nature. 'Tis ſayd of Chriſt
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:47519:64"/>
that he <hi>manifeſted forth his glory</hi> when he did that firſt miracle of turning the water into Wine: there he wrought,<note place="margin">John 2.11.</note> and put forth as hee was; glorious power then began to worke; according to its own abſolute and glorious nature. As every thing doth, and will neceſſarily worke, according to its own nature; what glory any flowe hath cloſed up in its nature, and within its one bud, it will put forth. The reſult of all is this, power works gloriouſly, neceſſarily, naturally; in a way of grace, and engaged providence, and not glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly in way of miracle now under the Goſpell.</p>
               <p>So much to be had, and ſo litle enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed makes mee wonder and grieve: grace communicable, and grace unto glory, and yet men have no grace, Heaven com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municable, and yet men in hell, glory communicable, and yet many in ſinne, in ſhame; how comes this? <hi>England</hi> is rich and yet many beggars and tatter'd Creatures, neither foode nor clothing: is all well order'd? doth every one worke hard? were every one diligent might they not live well in <hi>England?</hi> is there
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:47519:65"/>
not plenty of bread, plenty of clothing; fine bread, glorious apparell; Heaven drops and it drops fatneſſe, why are your ſoules ſo leane? in your fathers houſe is bread enough; feaſting, banqueting, junketing, glorious diſhes in wiſdomes houſe, how is it that you have nothing? not enough to hold life and ſoule toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther? power workes gloriouſly, you feele none; under the power of ſinne, as if there were no power of God at all work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in the World.</p>
               <p>Sinners, the firſt thing that I have to tell you from this point is that, you are wholly without excuſe. There is power enough working to ſubdue the ſtrong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt luſt, what then can you plead? will not <hi>glorious power</hi> lead captivity, cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive? kill killing ſinnes? men ſinne and lay it upon their weakneſſe, and ſo reſt and rub on? ah Lord! what a life is this GOD will judge you, and lay it upon your wickedneſſe; is not <hi>glorious power</hi> able to relieve in any ſtate? weakeneſſe becomes wickedneſſe as it is reſted in, and pleaded for: a ſoule given to ſhifting hath no mind to leave his ſinne, there is no damning temper but this. This is
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:47519:65"/>
one principle that ſprings from this point there muſt be no pleading for ſin; no not for any ſinne, though never ſo great and ſtrong, the remedy is ſo ready, ſo glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly all ſufficient.</p>
               <p>A ſecond principle that ſprings from this point, is this. <hi>That ſinne hath its no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torious aggravation:</hi> how great is that ſinne which is committed under the neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect of <hi>glorious power!</hi> within the reach of a <hi>glorious arme!</hi> GOD doth number ſinne, and meaſure ſinne, he gives it a name, and a proper name: ſinne, and ſuch a ſinne, he calls it by its kinde, and by its colour, skarlet and crimſon. As there is a <hi>glorious power,</hi> ſo there bee glorious ſinnes, <hi>Splendida peccata,</hi> skar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>let, crimſon ſinnes, and theſe are ſuch as are committed againſt glorious meanes, glorious light, grace, and aid. Sinne is aggravated but from one ſtander by, but he is more then all, more then a thouſand witneſſes.</p>
               <p>Who did heare? who did ſee? who did accuſe? who did grieve? who would have relieved? what power had his to relieve? ſo will GOD plead with poore ſinners; ſo will hee circumſtance, and
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:47519:66"/>
take the dimenſion of your ſinnes, theſe little daſhes and ſtrokes by the firſt line will draw it forth to a great breadth, and make it looke very broad, blacke, and bloudy; the ground-worke, and firſt draught thus filld up, will make the face of ſinne looke very ugly. Sinners you ſinne under obſervation: yea, that's not all, you ſinne under ag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gravation, this will bring condemna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, the condemnation, <hi>This is the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation that light is come into the World, &amp;c.</hi> Power, <hi>glorious power,</hi> workes in the World and yet men lie in their ſinnes.</p>

                  </label> At what height you ſinne, ſinners, at that height you will periſh. Power that workes gloriouſly to ſave, will worke to condemne, if neglected; if it cannot get the firſt end it will get the ſecond; GOD never loſeth all by any man.

               <p>A fourth principle which ſprings out of <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> this point, and which concerneth us all is; <hi>That our condition is very advanceable.</hi> Power workes gloriouſly, you may live, very neare Heaven, as well as very far

of, if you will, you may ſee the holy Land, you may eat cluſters of the fruit of the Country above. As you order things you may live in Heaven or Hell here. Chriſtians I have a high queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to aske you, how neare Heaven do you live? doe you ſee it? do you feele it? did you ever? have you any bunches of the fruit of the holy Land? The ſpirit of God is in you, but is the ſpirit of glory, and of God in you? you have grace; but have you grace and peace? you may have grace and peace, but are theſe multiplied, as the Apoſtle ſpeaks, to a glorious height? doth a glorious ſpirit and power dwell and worke in you? <hi>my Dove which art in the cleft of the Rockes</hi> (ſaith Chriſt) <hi>let mee ſee thy counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance, and heare thy voyce, &amp;c.</hi> So ſay I to you Chriſtians which are in deſolate conditions mourning amongſt Rocks, and hard-ſhips like doves, let me ſee your countenance, let mee heare your voice, what is your peace, your joy, your love, your hope? all theſe are the rays and beams of a <hi>glorious power.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I have none ſays one, I never had ſays another I doubt whether ever I
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:47519:68"/>
ſhall ſays an other, this laſt I like worſt, for ſurely hee is furtheſt off from the bleſſing of <hi>glorious power.</hi> There be but two things that I know which hinder power from working gloriouſly, glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fyingly in the ſoule, and they are ſinne loved and unbeliefe; I will inſiſt upon theſe a little, becauſe I would have thoſe that mourne, comforted; all that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long to Heaven, in Heaven. From ſinne no man can ceaſe, but ceaſe love to ſinne, if yee would have a Heaven upon earth, a <hi>glorious power</hi> and preſence of GOD in you. Render your ſpirits free to God, let them not be inſnar'd with any luſt, ſuch intanglement ſpoiles your glory, kills a glorious working ſpirit and pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er in you. Set wide open your hearts, thoſe everlaſting-doores to the King of Glory, and onely, to the King of Glory, and the King of Glory in much glory wil come in; a glorious Throne will hee erect in your ſoules. Pure hearts ſee the Face of God; impure, onely the black back-parts of GOD. Bleſſed are the pure in heart, they ſee GOD. The heart is pure as love is pure, love is pure as it goes all to Chriſt, to him that is all pure.
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:47519:68" rendition="simple:additions"/>
As love goes all to Chriſt, ſo it turnes all into Heaven, in the heart; <hi>into glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious preſence.</hi> All our worke ſhould be, to be diſingaging out hearts ſtill from all here; Heaven comes into the heart as earth goes out, the heart ſees God as it purifyes it ſelfe. <hi>Bleſſed are the pure in heart for they ſhall ſee God.</hi> Purity makes capacity of Heaven; a cleane heart is Chriſts moſt intimate companion, hee ſpreades open his Glory in this Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome.</p>
               <p>The holy'ſt men have alwayes had the moſt glorious viſions, as <hi>Daniel,</hi> and <hi>Iob.</hi> God chuſes his place to make Heaven; he makes Heaven above; in <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> that is above: in ſoules that are above, above the vanities of this World, in love and deſire, he makes a Heaven. <hi>Moſes</hi> is led up to a mount to ſee <hi>Canaan;</hi> Chriſt upon a mount had his glorious transfiguration; he had his Heaven up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on a mount. Love muſt mount above all theſe low things, ere the ſoule can ſee Heaven; enjoy <hi>glorious preſence.</hi> You cannot lie-along upon earth, and ſee the Heaven of Heavens; you may lie along upon earth, and ſee earthly Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens,
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:47519:69"/>
that muſt paſſe away. Sinne loved and the ſoule chuſes his Heaven here, no man ſhall have two Heavens, two Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens that differ <hi>ſpecie.</hi> Power will not work gloriouſly in that heart that works filthily. A man may ſee hell in his ſinne but ſhall never ſee Heaven. It falles out unhapily ſtill with man, when hee goes about to make a heaven here, when hee ſets love at worke to take her fortune, to make her glory and felicity here be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low as ſhee can; this checkes the work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of a <hi>glorious power</hi> in any heart, and ſets it a working another way, to whip the man with vexation of ſpirit, for ſeeking Heaven in Earth, in glorious vanities.</p>
               <p>So far as the heart is unmortifyed, 'tis not ſimple with God; ſimplicity is an abſolute requiſite, to make capacity of a glorious working power in the ſoule. God deſcended like a Dove, upon a Dove; ſweetely and gloriouſly, upon him in whoſe mouth was no guile. A heart and a heart, has none of Gods heart. God never proclaimes himſelfe well-pleaſed in that heart, which makes not him his pleaſure. Divine Power
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:47519:70"/>
workes not gloriouſly, where the heart works baſely: An hypocrite has leaſt of Heaven of any man, and moſt of hell.</p>
               <p>As men draw neere to God, ſo they ſee him; neere to him in quality, and neer to him in duty. We ſee heaven beſt up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on our knees. As wee glorify God, ſo hee glorifyes us. When we open our mouths wide, hee gives us great things, filling things; when we beg for flaggons we are ſtay'd with them. At the throne of grace, we finde grace, grace in glory; heaven at Gods feet; when moſt in his preſence, moſt in Heaven. A man muſt goe to heaven to finde heaven: a man muſt live in heaven, to have heaven live in him. Much going to heaven, brings heaven at laſt, downe along with one. Things doe worke beſt in their owne element; power works moſt gloriouſly in heaven; the neerer the heart comes to heaven in ſimplicity, in purity, in pure qualities and habits, in pure acts and exerciſe, the more glorious doth power wo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ke in the ſoule ſtill.</p>
               <p>Unbeliefe is another hinderance of a glorious working power: <hi>Said I not
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:47519:70"/>
if yee would believe, yee ſhould ſee the glory of God?</hi> ſaith Chriſt. <hi>By faith</hi> Enoch <hi>was tranſlated.</hi> Soule tranſlations, ſoule lift<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings up, ſoule raptures are in faith, in the ſtrong exerciſe of faith. As wee kiſſe, we are kiſſed. As we embrace, wee are embraced. <hi>I am my wel-beloveds; and my well-beloved is mine.</hi> An act of faith, and then an act of recompence, an act of joy. An act of truſt, and then an act of returne. <hi>I am my welbeloveds, and my wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beloved is mine.</hi> This is power working, and then glorifying its owne worke in the heart. Tis the ſoules going out to Chriſt like <hi>Zacheus,</hi> and then bringing Chriſt home with him, and after this follow feaſting and joy, and giving away any thing, whilſt hee is enjoy'd, that is all. Things worke as they are in ſight; 'tis ſo in the body, 'tis ſo in the ſoule. Faith ſets glorifyed Chriſt in ſight; glorify'd Chriſt in ſight makes glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious worke in the heart: <hi>In whom though now yee ſee him not, yet believing, yee re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyce with joy unſpeakeable and full of glory.</hi> —In whom though now yee ſee him not; that is, bodily: <hi>but believing,</hi> that is, ſeeing him ſoulely. As our ſoule viſion
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:47519:71"/>
is ſo in our ſoule ſtate, for joy, or griefe, ſhame or glory. If the ſoule can ſee light in the countenance of Chriſt, t'ath joy, glory, heaven as full as it can hold; if no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but darkeneſſe, t'ath nothing but griefe. As yee believe, ſo is your Heaven or hell.</p>
               <p>With a note of admiration, I will con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude this point. Chriſtians admire love that makes two heavens for ſuch as are worthy of none. Is it not enough that power workes gloriouſly above, but muſt it worke ſo here too? <hi>I am not wor<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>thy, that thou ſhould'ſt come under my roofe</hi> ſaid he, and yet Chriſt was not then in ſtate; that Chriſt in ſtate, in glory, ſhoud come under ſuch a roofe, ſuch a rotten roofe, as ours here is! That light ſhould ariſe in darkeneſſe, tooke the Pſalmiſt much: that glorious light ſhould ariſe in a poore darke ſoule, <hi>glorious power</hi> in a poore over-borne ſinfull ſoule, ſhould wonderfully affect us, and ſet us into holy admiration! <hi>If a man die ſhall he live againe?</hi> ſaid <hi>Iob.</hi> Thus much tooke him. How much more then ſhould this. If a man live, ſhall he live againe? If a man have a heaven here, ſhall he have
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:47519:71"/>
another hereafter. If a man have glory here, ſhall he have glory againe? ſhall he have glory upon glory? <hi>be cloathed upon?</hi> Out of Heaven into Heaven? ſhall he paſſe from glory to glory by the ſpirit and power of God?</p>
               <p>Chriſtians what a King of glory doe wee waite upon! Beb-chamber, dining-roome glorious: yea, hall and out-roomes, which border upon hell, <hi>glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious:</hi> power works gloriouſly in a houſe not made with hands; yea, and in a houſe made with hands, with earthen hands, and earthen feete. Power works gloriouſly in Earth, formes an earthen Veſſell unto glory, formes glory unto it, in it; puts glory in the earthen Veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſell, and then puts the earthen Veſſell into glory. <hi>The Queenes Daughter is all glorious,</hi> indeed: glorious within, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out; glorious hereafter, yea, glorious here. It lies upon you Chriſtians admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ringly to ſpeake and talke of theſe things. <hi>They] ſhall ſpeake of the glory of thy Kingdome, and talke of thy power, &amp;c. Pſal.</hi> 145.11. Yea, not onely admire it, but draw comfort from it, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to all your feares and diſtreſſes.
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:47519:72"/>
What can yee want, which <hi>glorious power</hi> cannot helpe you to? What is it, that Heaven cannot make up? Suck this Honey-combe your ſelves, I onely can put it into your hand. Time calles mee away.</p>

                  <hi>Patience is a holy be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haviour in affliction; Tis virtus verſata circa adverſa.</hi> A grace that keepes man gracious, in all conditions; good in a bad condition; holy, againſt all diſad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages of holineſſes, within or with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out. Man is a creature ſince his fall full of wants, and as full of diſquiet, and this turnes all wants into ſinnes and miſeries: he is a creature beſide the rule, and his puniſhment for this, keeps him beſide the rule through diſquiet, and ſo ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders man totally miſerable; miſerable without any felicity, or hope of felicity: this is the gall of bitterneſſe, which pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence takes away.</p>
               <p>Patience takes away the ſinne of mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſery; the miſery of miſery; the afflicting ſtrength of miſery; the ſting and teeth of every affliction; the malignity of every cup of trembling; the unhappi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of every ſad condition, and makes a felicity in miſery. <hi>'Tis rectitudo animi ſub ſtatu infelici.</hi> A rectitude of mind, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der a croſſe and crooked condition: A heart moving by the word of God, when

               <p>Patience is a ſoule enjoying it ſelfe in every condition, when nothing elſe.<note place="margin">Anima in omni ſemet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ipſa fruens.</note> There is more truth in the underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, then power of truth in the heart; therefore is man though very knowing, yet very unruly when all ſuits not to his will; hence 'tis that the ſoule can hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly enjoy it ſelfe, when it cannot enjoy all it would.

Patience can give no ill language, how ill ſoever it goes with her friend, in whoſe houſe ſhee dwells. Patience is a ſilent laying downe all at Gods feete: 'tis a chriſtian proclaiming freedome to Chriſt, to doe his owne will with him and his, in love. Patience was never knowne to put any other limitation up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the almighty.

God has freedome proclaimed him, to doe what he will, with a patient man; nothing ſhall be retorted upon

him. Patience can be in honour, in diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grace, high or low at Gods diſpoſe and be contented. A patient man can live; can die, and ſee advantage in either: to live, Chriſt: to die, more Chriſt the, greateſt gaine of all: hee can ſee gaine in all that God does; gaine in ſickeneſſe, gaine in diſgrace, gaine in loſſe; the greateſt gaine in the great'ſt loſſe; ſoule-gaine, in bodily loſſe; and therefore can patience ſpeake of evills as good, of bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters as very ſweet.

As the ſoule in ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremity ſtayes it ſelfe upon truth, ſo 'tis believing; as it expects accompliſhment of truth, ſo it riſes to hope: as it waits for what it expects, ſo it riſes higher, and this act of the ſoule is properly cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led patience.

husband from wife, ſoule from body; he is ſetting every relation a bleeding, one in the boſom of another: this calles loud for patience.</p>
               <p>God ſeems to be dealing with <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> as with <hi>Job:</hi> yea, with every good man in <hi>England</hi> as with <hi>Iob;</hi> he ſeemes to be as one reſolved to try us all to the quick, in Country and City; to bring us to a morſell of Bread; to ſtrip us of all (which God knowes <hi>England</hi> hath abuſed) and to ſet us upon a dunghill licking our wounds; to take away all, and then to ſet us in the want of all, to complaine for pity to them that will ſhew none, but powre Vineger into our wounds, when we cry for mercy. Ah Chriſtians! will not ſuch a condition call for patience? All in action now calles for nothing but patience; all in view now, calles for nothing but patience: what a double miſerable man is that, which lives in <hi>England</hi> now without pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience! and yet Lord how much doe I ſee it wanting every where!</p>
               <p>I ſee an evill ſpringing up in theſe E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vill Times, which will ſpoile us all, if GOD prevent it not, and that is impati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence:
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:47519:79"/>
activity degenerates into impati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence; forward men can beare no check from providence, the moſt forward men, are become the moſt froward men: we ſet our mercies a day (which is more then we can anſwer) and becauſe God doth not obſerve our limitation, we flee out in heart and tongue fearefully. 1. I am weary of this City to heare the mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muring and impatience that is in it. The Country looks upon the City, the City looks upon the Parliament, the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment looks one upon another; Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons upon Lords, Lords upon Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons, all upon the King, and all looke ſhort of the King of Kings; this God ſaw right well, the fruit of it is upon us; we have loſt much mercy this way, and now are at murmuring hard that we may loſe all, relieving preſence in the wilderneſſe, and <hi>Canaan</hi> too. Will mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muring and impatience ever bring us into that <hi>Canaan</hi> we hope for? Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans you feare the King, you feare the Cavaliers, you feare Comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, you feare the Parliament, I tell you my heart; I am more afraid of you, of your unbeliefe, of your impa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience,
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:47519:79"/>
that this will prove a City ſpoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, a Kingdome ſpoyling evill a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove all.</p>
               <p>I will give you ſome principles of pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n=".1"/> reſpecting our ſtate and condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, as things now ſtand and goe with us, which is the beſt ſervice (I think I can doe you, The firſt principle is this, <hi>God takes time to adminiſter to publique bodies. England</hi> hath beene a long time polluting her ſelfe, and this not with a Low but with a very high hand, God is going gently to repeate over all, and will you not give him time? 'tis but Juſtice to allow much time to one that is to repeate much. What hath been the courſe of the publique, for this twenty yeares together, you have forgotten: what hath been your courſe for twenty, forty, fifty yeares, for theſe hundred yeares, ſince we and our fathers have enjoy'd the Goſpell, you have forgot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten: how cold, how formalizing; how careleſſe in your Families, how Exceſſive and abuſive of the creature, how bowel-leſſe and mercy-leſſe; who can reckon up how you have ordered your time and talents? God can, but he
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:47519:80"/>
muſt have time: will you thruſt much work upon God, and not give him time to goe through with it? God takes time to adminiſter Juſtice: he was fourty years telling <hi>Iſrael,</hi> how they grieved him by their murmuring: you would think much, if he ſhould be ſo long a telling <hi>England,</hi> of her preſent mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muring. So afterwards he took eight yeares, and then eighteen yeares, and then twenty yeares, to tell <hi>Iſrael</hi> what they did under their Judges; and then ſeventy yeares to tell <hi>Iſrael</hi> what they did under their Kings: not any publique body that I know of in the Scripture, but when God hath come to adminiſter Juſtice to it, he hath taken ſome yeares to doe it. Great houſes that have many roomes in them, and theſe very foule, cannot be ſwept preſently.</p>
               <p>Secondly, as God takes time to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſter Juſtice to publick bodies, ſo he takes time to adminiſter mercy to pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick bodies. The Tabernacle was long a raiſing; the firſt Temple which was to exceed that, longer; the ſecond Temple which was to exceed that, much longer; and the third which is to exceed
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:47519:80"/>
all, longeſt of all. The tent or Taber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nacle which was but ſmall (I judge) was a yeare a making: the firſt Temple, ſeaven yeares: the ſecond Temple, forty and ſix yeares: if this had any typicall ſignification (as I believe it had) it might well point at this, that a pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick houſe for Chriſt, under the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell, would be long a raiſing; I meane, a worſhip ſuiteable to Gods Will, borne up by publick authority. According to what way God will diſpence himſelfe, 'tis Juſtice and duty to waite for him: I finde not one hint in Scripture, of ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daine raiſing this laſt houſe. You ſhew your ſelves ignorant men, you erre, not knowing the Scriptures, which are im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patient becauſe travailing <hi>England</hi> is not delivered in an houre, in a yeare. We have ſcarce travailed ſo long yet, as the Tabernacle was a building; ſure I am, not ſo long as the firſt Temple was a building, there is no ground therefore of impatience, who have more noble things in hand. The ſon riſes more and more, and ſo muſt up to the perfect day; this is the order that Chriſt will proceed in, to bring full mercy into the World
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:47519:81"/>
will you be impatient, that the ſun riſes no faſter? that he is not at the meridian, as ſoon as the day dawnes?</p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> A ſecond principle is this, <hi>God doth fit for favours and then</hi> gives them: he doth hew ſtones, for this laſt Temple. We are a generation low in ſpirit, and yet impatient that we have not high things. Doe you give children and fools what they deſire? doe you not inſtruct and diſcipline, and then give? yea and then too, what in your wiſdom you know good. We are utterly below high things, affraid of full mercies: is it not the feare of ſome, that the Puritan faction (as they call them) will be too ſtrong? the diſcipline of the Goſpell too ſtrict? our ſpirits are baſe to God, and yet we won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der that noble things are not given un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to us. Doe not men play with their light? prefer policy to truth? Judge that Chriſt may weare a party coloured coat; mans wiſdom, mixt with Gods; our own inventions and truth weaved to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether. Tell me the beſt of you all, which are ſo impatient for reformation, which amongſt you all doth deale ſo fairely with your light, and ſo ſimply with your
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:47519:81"/>
conſcience, as to render your ſelves ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable of ſo great a good, as you ſeeme to wrangle for? Let things goe how they will, you can ſtill ſhuffle along; is not a ſhuffling condition fit for a ſhuffling ſpirit? God walkes to you as you walke to him, and yet you are impatient: he cuts you out a condition with his Sword, ſuitable to your hearts; he ſees what con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences you have, that you ſtick at no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, why ſhould he remove what you can ſwallow? why ſhould you thinke much to live upon Huskes, if you can eate Huskes? when I looke upon that cold, neutrall, indifferent ſpirit, that is, in Engliſh Chriſtians generally. I wonder to heare any complaine, that their beſt mercies are ſo long a comming. You impatiently talke of the Parliament, of the Army, of this and that, one is this and another is that, and therefore your mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſery lives, your mercies linger, and you die: I tell you, 'tis <hi>Englands</hi> neutrality, that hath brought her to this ſtate, that keeps her in this ſtate, that will ſpend her and end her with bleeding, if any thing doe.</p>
               <p>A third principle is this, <hi>inferiour a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gents <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/>
                     <pb n="144" facs="tcp:47519:82"/>
are all over-ruled; Judas</hi> and his bloudy crew, move by a ſupreame coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell, they could not elſe have done to Chriſt what they did, and ſo Chriſt told them. Providence orders all agent and actions, to her own end; not to ſuch an end, propoſed by ſuch a man: if love be in the breaſt of the firſt agent 'tis no matter how all other agents act you are to conclude they act well ſtill, though you cannot ſee it: no heart could be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patient, or wrangle, if this principle were but well ſwallowed. Actions and agents may move very ſtrangely in our view, and yet very orderly to the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt good, as their ſupernaturall end. I would aske any impatient ſoule but this, what is in the breaſt of God reſpecting our cauſe? love, or not love? if you Judge love to be in God to our cauſe, believe that all agents and actions are or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered by it, and will bring forth in Gods time, a bleſſed end.</p>
               <p>A fourth principle is this, <hi>The imploy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of War is a new thing to England:</hi> a councell of War and a councell of State, are two things: experience, makes Expertneſſe 'tis weakeneſſe to fall out
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:47519:82"/>
which young beginners, becauſe not expert: every one doth not know how to ſtick a Hog to the heart at one thruſt, ſuch muſt have the liberty to thruſt a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine, and 'tis well if they kill him at laſt. Would you have men old Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers, which never ſaw the field before? let any Chronicle produce braver cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage and carriage by young beginners, then ours have hitherto ſhewen both at <hi>Kenton</hi> and <hi>Branford?</hi> Paſſion makes u<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

               <p>A fift principle is this, <hi>Gods provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> makes up mans improvidence.</hi> God we ſee is by ſo much the more watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, that we are unskilfull, have we cauſe then to be impatient? did not Gods providence make up our improvidence at <hi>Branford?</hi> could ſo many elſe have been kept, from comming to the gates of your City, by ſo few? and ſo unarmed? our men wanted powder and ſhot, and our God ſhot off for them, and for us, or elſe certainly we had had their Cannon, thundering about our Ears, for a Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath peale. Many advantages we have given them, but they are curſt to the
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:47519:83"/>
adverſary, they doe not thrive with them; they labour in the very fire, and blaſt themſelves upon the top of their beſt advantages. When God is al-ſufficient, in ſuch a redundant ſence as this, to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply over ſight, by his watchfull Eye, what ſoule dares to murmure?</p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="6"/> A ſixt principle is this, <hi>Impatience a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt called inſtruments to any worke, is impatience againſt GOD, and hee will take it ſo:</hi> who is <hi>Moſes?</hi> and who is <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ron?</hi> that you murmure againſt them? who is the Parliamente that you are im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patient againſt it? are they not a called body by God? are they not wiſe men, ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly men; true hearted, tender hearted; and wiſh you as well as themſelves, as well as you can wiſh your ſelves! Doe they not uſe the beſt ability they have to doe us ſervice? ſhall we requite them for all, coſt and paines, with murmur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing againſt them?

               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="7"/> Finally, God will ſo carry the great workes of theſe laſt times, that all men ſhall acknowledge him and not any man, which ſhould make us patient
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:47519:83"/>
that we can ſee man no more: that we can ſee man no more in our great works, a Finger of GOD is in it, that he may be ſeene and admired, as the Authour of all. The Prophet ſpeaking (and certainly of this time) how this Genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion ſhould come downe, ſaith,<note place="margin">Hab. 2.13.</note>

For the Earth (ſaith hee) ſhall bee fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led with the Knowledge of the Glory of the Lord, &amp;c.</hi> Not with the Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of the Glory of any man. Men can doe no more then they can; men ſhall doe no more then they doe, that you make not Gods of them: That you have no advantage to make a man a GOD, are you impatient? that God will not uſe whom you will, and how you will, therefore are you impatient: that God is not ſo wiſe as you, that hee loves not himſelfe, ſo well as you love him, therefore are you im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patient.</p>
               <p>To conclude all, let mee aske you all one queſtion more; wherein hath GOD given you cauſe to bee impa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient from the firſt of our troubles
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:47519:84"/>
till now? for which of his good deeds doe you ſtone him? (for truely impa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience is no other but a ſtoning of Chriſt) for his good deeds at <hi>Hull?</hi> For his good deeds at <hi>Ports-mouth?</hi> for his good deedes at <hi>Kenton?</hi> What hath Chriſt done from the beginning of this Parliament to this day, to caſt diſcouragement upon any ſoule? To caſt any heart into a paſſion. Let his dealings beſpeake you patient. I ſay no more.</p>

                  <pb n="162" facs="tcp:47519:91"/>I will tell you the evils of impatience, that you may dread it and every degree of it, and make them as I name them, motives to endeavor after all Pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence <hi>(i)</hi> a heart freed from all impa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience.</p>
               <p>The firſt evil is this, ſo farre as the ſoule is impatient, ſo farre 'tis ſet at a diſtance from God. Impatience, grieves: God grieved, withdrawes. So farre as <hi>Saul</hi> rages, ſo farre is the Spirit of God gon. So farre as the ſoule is ſhut out from God, 'tis ſhut out from al. A bedlam is put alone, and there chained, and whipt; he is fit for no company but for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lorne ſpirits like himſelfe, a Legion of theſe poſſeſſe every impatient ſoule. No ſoule hath leſſe fellowſhip with God, then paſſionate. God cannot dwell in fire, nor worke in fire, any otherwiſe then to torment the tormented. Froward children are frowned upon, and kept at a great diſtance, 'till their hearts come downe. A ſoule that hath little of God, hath much of the devil: if you would ſee the devil face to face, looke a paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſionate man in the face; you ſhall ſee the devils eyes, his browes, his tongue, his
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:47519:91"/>
mouth, al as blacke, as horrid, as firey as <hi>Hell.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>A ſecond evill of impatience is this; <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> Impatience maimes parts, gifts, graces, and makes a man otherwiſe able, feeble and uſeleſſe. <hi>The counſells of the froward are carried head long</hi> ſaith the holy Ghoſt: if their counſels, how much more then thoſe things they doe without counſell? and thus moſt an end doe paſſionate men doe, all they doe. Paſſion puts out a man's eyes, cuts-off a man's armes; it thruſts a man in haſt ſtill, to the wrong doore, to the wrong end of his buſines. Paſſion cannot obſerve <hi>modus</hi> nor <hi>media agendi,</hi> 'twil up to the top of the houſe preſently, before there be any ſtaires made: 'twil run and leave tools behind, yea, 'twill run and leave God behind, and ſo buries her honour ſtill, in an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timely birth. A paſſionate man hath <hi>Reu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bens</hi> judgement written in his forehead, —<hi>never to excell.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thirdly, impatience is the mother of <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> al evil: 'tis a ſin-teeming temper: it brings forth children to old Age, and then moſt of al; paſſion in old Age brings forth by troopes. Impatience, 'tis a

ſpirit ſet on fire of <hi>Hell,</hi> prepared and ready to every helliſh worke; to ſweare, to curſe, to kill; to ſpeak evil, to doe evil: tis a ſhort poſſeſſion; a man mad for ſo many houres, that will not ſtick at any thing that the devil and deprav'd nature bid him doe: he wil flee in the face of ſervants, children, wife, magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate, God, any one: 'tis a Snake, whoſe tongue is his ſting, his teeth poyſon; he takes in and caſts up venome by mouth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuls: his heart brings forth ſinnes by troopes; he ſpeaks as many ſinnes, as words: he burnes al black with too much heat: he over-heats words, workes, the wheeles light a fire ſtill in carriage, eſpecially when loaded with any heft, and burne cart and carriage both. Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, 'tis the devils glaſſe-houſe, black fire workemen are at it in this ſoule day and night: tis the devils ſinne-moul'd, to make many ſins quickly; many great ſins on a ſudden.</p>

               <p>There is no divine contemplation in an impatient heart, which is that that makes Heaven here; So that an impati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent man, loſes his Heaven here-after and here too.

Paſſion degenerates into malice, and then the man becomes <hi>Meditabundus,</hi> full of thoughts, but more diabolicall then be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, and further from Heaven: his thoughts now travell when hee is on his bed, compaſſing the Earth too and fro like the devil, but aſcend not to Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, no, not one of them. All thoughts are kept in a hudle in a paſſionate ſoule, one crowding, and clambering on the back of another; one, ſtill joſtling a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt another; no leiſure, for the ſoule to withdraw to God: divine guidance is gone, and the ſoule hath no command of it ſelfe Heaven-ward: the ſtring of
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:47519:93"/>
the watch is broke, and the wheeles run down til they breake too; no winding up can be made. Paſſion cannot pray, cannot heare, cannot read, leaſt of all can it meditate, which is the life of al. What can a paſſionate man doe, which is appointed by God as a <hi>Medium,</hi> to carry the ſoule to Heaven?</p>
               <p>Finally, a Paſſionate man is fit for no <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="6"/> condition: not fit to be rich, for this wil make him a Tyrant, a devil with hornes: Not fit to be poore, this wil make him mad, a bedlam tyed up. A paſſionate man is neither fit to worke, nor play, to be ſick, nor wel, to be at home nor be abroad, to live nor dye: no body pleaſes him, nor he pleaſes no body; 'tis an <hi>Eſau,</hi> a rough man, his hand is againſt every man, and every mans hand is againſt him: tis a Bile that rages when one goes, and when one ſits, lying down and riſing up, at bed and at boord, not fit for Heaven, moſt fit for <hi>Hell,</hi> and yet there is no need of him, for there bee devils enough already, and fire-brands enough to employ them. Let God doe what he wil, an impatient man is never contented. Let <hi>Jonah</hi> have no
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:47519:94"/>
blowes and he is impatient, let him be ſcorcht without and he burnes within. An impatient man ever wantes ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, and yet never can tel wel what will pleaſe him: hee ſtandes much upon his wil, 'tis dearer then his ſoule, 'tis dearer then GOD, and yet it va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries as oft as temptation preſents, and the man knowes not wel what he would have; Ah Lord! what a plague? What a changeling? What a ſoule be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>witcht is this?

Chriſtians feele their hearts begin to burn, and make not haſt to God; they goe not quickly with their cenſer, when this plague is begun, and then is the devil too hard, and they complaine as overcome.

                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> A Chriſtians condition is improved, Chriſtians are Gods Vineyard; into this
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:47519:97"/>
Vineyard God ſends labourers to worke hard, and to worke ſo, long; to the ſixth, ninth and laſt houre, to make much fruit. Afflictons are Gods day-labourers; they work and worke thoroughout mans day, to plow and breake up his fallow heart; to grub up rootes, bitter rootes, and to prepare the way of the Lord, for good fruit. As God hath day-labourers to belabour the eare, the heart, the inward man, and theſe kept at worke till the ninth and laſt houre of mans life; ſo hee hath day-labourers to be labour the back, the belly, the outward man, and theſe kept at worke as long as the other, as long as man lives, the one to prepare the way for the other; one to plow and breake up, and the other to ſow. The heart of man, hath an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>expreſſible hardneſſe, the hardneſſe of an <hi>Adamant;</hi> many blowes will not break this ſtone: it muſt be ſoakt in teares, and in bloud long.</p>
               <p>Afflictions are bitters to weane,<note place="margin">To mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate in lawfull things.</note> from ſweets that are not neceſſary.

                  <note place="margin">To take away un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawfull things.</note>Afflictions are to take away ſinne: <hi>By this therefore ſhall the iniquity of</hi> Jacob <hi>be purged, and this is all the fruit, to take away his ſinne, &amp;c. Iſa.</hi> 27.9. Afflictions and ſufferings were onely to torture ſin, this might quickly be done, but they are to take away ſinne, this is long work. The furnace is to purify; it muſt be heate and heate long, to melt and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregate, to diſcover, diſperſe, and take away droſſe. Afflictions are to worke truth in the inward parts, tis long ere man be good at heart: they are to height<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en integrity, tis longer ere the heart become ſo upright, as to be a heart after Gods owne heart: tis long ere a foule ſtomake will be made vomit up all, tis long ere man will be brought to obſerve all Gods will, this makes great plagues and of long continuance. If thou will not obſerve to doe all the words of this Law, that are written in this booke,
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:47519:98"/>
that thou maiſt feare this glorious and fearefull name, THE LORD THY GOD. Then the Lord will make thy plagues wonderfull, and the plagues of thy ſeed, even great plagues and of long continuance, [<hi>and ſore ſickeneſſes and of long continuance. Deutrenomy</hi> 28.58, 59.</p>
               <p>God puts weight,<note place="margin">To ſerve in truth.</note> great weight up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on truth, to make it enter, and make thorough impreſſion: truth is managed with great art, to put back every ſpring, and to make the bolt goe forth as far as it ſhould, and as faſt and facile as it ſhould. <hi>Let theſe ſayings ſinke downe into your eares; for the Sun of man ſhall be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered into the hands of men. Luke</hi> 9.44. Chriſt made a weight of himſelfe, and ties this to his words, to make them ſinke down into mens hearts: he makes a weight now of us, ſpeakes and then ſtrikes, ſtrikes and ſtrikes often and long, and then ſayes ſecretly to the ſoule, let theſe and theſe words now <hi>ſinke down into their eares.</hi> Chriſt is faine to bore way for truth, to bore a long hole, from the eare to the heart, and this many times is a long while a doing, ſix yeeres ten yeers, twenty yeers.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="178" facs="tcp:47519:99"/>A Chriſtians condition is conform'd: 'tis made to ſpeake Chriſt within and without; in ſpirit, in fleſh; the booke is written within and without; in our ſoules, in our bodies we are made to beare the markes of the Lord Jeſus; markes broad and long, juſt like his in every circumſtance. The plowers made —<hi>long furrowes</hi> on his back, as long as his life: he was <hi>acquainted with griefe:</hi> griefe and hee were long acquaintance, his whole voiage about this lower world was in ſtormes. <hi>A man of ſorrowes:</hi> his life made up of ſighs, groans, teares, words, bloud; thus breath'd, thus ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pir'd; a mourning life, a bleeding death. The ſervant is as his Lord; ſufferers both, as long as livers in this World: the Apoſtle apprehended theſe Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans would finde it ſo, therefore ſo prayd. <hi>Strengthened with all might according to his glorious power, unto all patience [and long-ſuffering with joyfulneſſe.</hi>

                  </label> I have given you a ſurvey of the way to Heaven, expect dirty lanes and very long. The way is narrow, tis ſo all a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long; ſcratching and tearing thornes and briers on both ſides, touching one
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:47519:99"/>
another, that 'tis hard to make one ſtep skin-whole. Can yee beare theſe ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings? Can yee beare ſuch doings? Can yee beare till your backes ake? Can yee beare till your backes breake? Can yee beare till you ſinke and die under your burden; Can yee ſuffer long? as long as yee live? Can yee leave all and fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low Chriſt? all your ſtate, all your limbes, all your comforts, al your dayes? Can yee ſpend and end your dayes in miſery, to be bleſſed in another world? you may think yee can doe ſo and be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived; <hi>Peter</hi> did ſo, I will ſpeake to this point a little.</p>
               <p>There be three ſorts of hearts which <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> cannot ſuffer long. A naturall heart, an engaged heart, a careleſſe heart. Can nothing, endure much? much, long? Can man beare much, which hath no ſhoulders? Can a profane heart, an hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocriticall heart, or what elſe carnall heart you can name, beare much they know not for what? ſuffer long and taſt not inwardly, for what? A <hi>Iudas</hi> will kiſſe Chriſt and depart, and hang him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe rather then be hang'd for Chriſt. Gold endures fire long, as long as you
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:47519:100"/>
will: caſt a <hi>Ioſeph,</hi> an upright man, into priſon, and he will lie there long, as long as the devill will, till the Iron, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter into his ſoule. Truth will live and die with truth. I will not wager a ſtraw upon any man for his parts, let them be what they will, in point of long ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing: what is the man at heart? that will he be for continuance in hardſhip for truth. Naturall courage may doe much in a deſperate way, but deliberate tryall, long ſuffering tyres this quite. Nature can goe no further, then ſhee can. The old man cannot travell; long paines and toile, will make him peti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion for a <hi>Quietus eſt,</hi> for an accommoda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, for any peace ſo he may ſit downe quiet, and ſleep in a whole skin:</p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> An engaged heart cannot ſuffer long. A <hi>Sampſon</hi> will give up at laſt, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tray his owne life, that is engaged in heart to pleaſe a wife, a friend, his own unmortifyed heart, any one before GOD. A heart that will bee drawne was never, will never be a long ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er: this is the worſt temper of all, for long worke: this man has his diſad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage within, Satan will often viſit
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:47519:100"/>
him, to ſpare himſelfe, and this heart will finde ſo much diſcretion at laſt, as to hearken to him, and chuſe ſinne ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther then ſuffering, then ſuffering long. I never knew a man that could be made, but Satan could doe it firſt or laſt. Ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the glory of this World, or the terrour of this World, the caſting down from a pinacle, will fetch about that man, in whoſe heart Satan when hee comes finds <hi>ſomething,</hi> ſome ſelfe-en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gagement. The heart ſo far as engaged, is ſelfiſh; ſo far as man is ſelfiſh, ſo far wil he admit of parley with the evil one, the divell was never admitted to parley with man, but he carried it; his Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment will ſway every ſelfiſh man, to looke to his skin and his life above his ſoule.</p>
               <p>A careleſſe ſpirit will never ſuffer <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> long. 'Tis ſome mans ſpirit, to make lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle of much, at a diſtance; ſuch men uſually ſinke under a little, when come upon them. Confident men, never prove long ſuffering men: juſtice makes ſuch know that they are but bubles, a little ſtir breakes them, a little heate diſſolves them. They are never in that
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:47519:101"/>
good Kings ſtrait,—<hi>We know not what to doe,</hi> ſo long as troubles keep at any diſtance, if it be but at skin diſtance, till troubles come to touch the skin, and touch to the quick, and then they know not what to doe indeed. 'Tis worſe then long ſuffering to ſome men, to be told of it, or to thinke of it; they drinke downe all; and feaſt dead their feares, and (I feare) their ſoules. Doe yee not ſee this? Is not <hi>London</hi> wanton and vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luptuous ſtill? What table can yee come at, that ſpeakes this, <hi>London is like to ſuffer long?</hi> Will feaſting fit for hungring and ſtarving? will the killing of your ſoules fit you for the killing of your bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies? Ah Lord! will wicked wantons, beaſtly belly-gods, drunken careles <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bals,</hi> prove long ſufferers for truth? will perſons that cannot now live with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out exceſſe, without too much and too fine, doe well when they ſhall want ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſaries, and want them long, longer then many others for much more abuſe? Surely theſe wretches will be doubly miſerable when miſery comes: they will wiſh themſelves any where, to be deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered from the fruit of their wayes. All
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:47519:101"/>
the Armour of God ſhould be look'd af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter with all diligence to make fit for long ſuffering, and careleſſe ſoules looke af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter none, and yet they dreame they ſhall ſuffer as long, and as well as the beſt, but they doe but dreame. They will loſe their ſoules in a dreame; their careleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe will make their long ſuffering as long as eternity.</p>
               <p>I have ſpoken to take off ſecurity I will alſo ſpeake ſomething to take off ſcandall &amp; ſo paſſe this point. Sufferings for truth fall out ſometimes to be many and long, this is the point, and this is likely to be our condition: <hi>Englands troubles looke as if they would be long,</hi> they have a long viſage in my eye two or three things make mee thinke our ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing wilbe long.</p>
               <p>The firſt is this, <hi>a ſpirit of confuſion is power'd out upon us:</hi> 'tis very generall and <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> very ſtrong. 'Twas ſo when the <hi>Jewes</hi> came firſt out of <hi>Babylon;</hi> when they came to <hi>Heruſalem</hi> to ſet about the build<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of Gods houſe, then fell in a ſpirit of ſtrong confuſion amongſt them; ſome were for the old houſe, ſome for the new; ſome Cried to thinke of the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternall
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:47519:102"/>
glory of the old houſe, others joy'd to ſee the beginnings of a more ſpirituall houſe; but this is very obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vable, the worſt note was the lowdeſt: a man could not diſcerne the noiſe of the ſhout of joy, for the beginnings of the new houſe, the noiſe of the weeping and crying of the people for the old, was ſo great: out of this ſpirit of confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion ſprung up Vipers and Serpents, ſuch as tooke this advantage, and hindered that great worke of the Lord many yeares, and made their ſuffering long, as you may ſee exactly in that ſtory. This is our caſe at this day: there are many joy to ſee ſome beginnings of a more pure worſhip; ſome hopes of raiſeing and finiſhing this, raiſeth their hearts: but there be many more which cry and take on, for the old houſe, for the pomp and glory of Biſhops, garments, pipes, carnall ordinances, which pleaſe car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall ſences, and the cry of theſe is ſo loud, that the joy of Gods people can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be heard; 'tis now as quite buried. Out of this confuſion hath ſprung up <hi>Sanballats</hi> and <hi>Tobias,</hi> ſtrong adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaries; ſo ſtrong, and ſo many, that they
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:47519:102"/>
are likely to hinder Gods building much, and make our ſuffering long.</p>
               <p>A ſecond thing that gives, our troubles <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> a long viſage in my eye, is this: <hi>A joſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling ſpirit of pride and frowardneſſe againſt authority;</hi> againſt thoſe which God hath wonderfully raiſed to deliver us, as wonderfully as ever he raiſed <hi>Moſes</hi> to deliver <hi>Iſrael</hi> out of <hi>Egypt. Yee take too much upon you ſaid Corah</hi> and his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany, <hi>ſeeing all the Congregation is holy (i)</hi> holy enough already. This is the very ſpirit and language of many great ones and ſmall ones, at this very day, reſpect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Parliament. They take too much upon them, things were well enough, as under the government of Biſhops, and as in Queene <hi>Elizabeths</hi> time, King <hi>Iame's</hi> time. Reformation in Church and ſtate according as our preſent con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, and the increaſe of light calles for, becauſe this attempted, renders the Parliament as odious in the eyes of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, great, and ſmall, as ever was <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes</hi> in the eye of <hi>Corah</hi> and his company, for diſcharging his conſcience. This ſpirit became very ſpreading then, and ſo ſtrong, that God was faine to make
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:47519:103"/>
                  <hi>Iſraels</hi> miſery long, till he had cut off all that were unworthy of that which <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes</hi> and <hi>Aaron</hi> laboured to bring them to: ſo may this ſpirit make our ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings long, ſo long, till God hath cut off al theſe proud joſtling ſpirits, which are altogether unworthy of thoſe great mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies, which our honeſt-hearted Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament, painefully labours to bring us to.</p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> A third thing that makes our troubles have a long viſage in my eye, is this, <hi>That the one thing neceſſary to publique wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fare, is not preferred and proſecuted, as ſuch a thing:</hi> that is, according to its dignity, and our duty. The maine thing (I conceive) to our publique wel-fare, is to perfect our reformation of Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, to raiſe up and finiſh that building, the foundation whereof our Fathers bravely laid, in their owne bloud. <hi>Iſrael</hi> ſuffer'd much, and ſuffer'd long, a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumption followed them, till it had brought them almoſt to nothing, becauſe they grew ſlack about the maine, and preferr'd their owne houſes, the ſeil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and finiſhing of them, before Gods Houſe. At firſt when they came toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:47519:103"/>
to <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> they were hot up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on Gods Houſe, but being diverted by troubles they grew cold, and invol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved their ſpirits in their owne affaires, which coſt them deare and brought them into a deepe conſumption: I am affraid this is our caſe. Our Parliament at firſt comming together, ſeem'd very hot about Church affaires (though not ſo hot then as, I could have wiſh't:) God had his Committee amongſt many other of our owne, I meane a Commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tee about ſcandalous Miniſters, and matters wherein God is moſt immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately concerned; this Committee was of life and heat a time, and the dread and Majeſty of that great Court here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by, great; many troubles came in, and this Committee laid downe, and other things relateing to this ſtay'd off; by meanes of which the Majeſty of that honourable Houſe is much weakened, becauſe God much neglected: I am af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fraide this will bring us into a deepe conſumption, and make <hi>Englands</hi> ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings long, becauſe wee make God ſuffer ſo long, all the Kingdome over, by blinde worſhip, and blind Miniſters,
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:47519:104"/>
who are now the activeſt Engines a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt us.</p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> A fourth thing which makes our troubles looke with a long viſage in my eye, is this, <hi>God hath ſuffered our troubles to grow beyond our Tiller,</hi> as the Archers terme is, our bow is made too ſtrong for us to bend, this makes long worke to bee ready. If an unruly child creep up under the lenity of Parents, to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come an unruly boy, one in bodily ſtrength, ſuiteable to his ſpirit, before taken downe, this ſpeakes long ſuffering to ſuch parents: this is <hi>Englands</hi> caſe. Our wicked children are growne up, under the wing and lenity of the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, to virility, to mans eſtate, to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternall ſtrength ſuiteable to their inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall temper, this I am affraid ſpeakes long ſuffering to thee, O poore <hi>England.</hi> Juſtice doth not looke as if ſhee would lay down her rod preſently, when ſhee is gathering more and more twigs. A few malignants are become many; many without Armes, many, in Armes: our locuſts goe forth by troopes. Juſtice doth not uſe to make a rod of ſo many, and ſo great twigs, for a little worke:
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:47519:104"/>
ſtrong twigs and rods are gather'd to laſt, for long work.</p>

                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> troubles looke with a long viſage in my eye, is this, <hi>A heavy ſpirit ſeemes to be fallen upon us, —Make their eares heavy</hi> (ſaith God) <hi>their Eares?</hi> that is, their hearts: I am affraid that plague is heavi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly fallen upon us. Heavy jades are ſhap'd to much beating; a little will not make them goe. Men come up to their light, like a beare to the ſtake: how heavy hath our motion beene, to blaſt the Common Prayer Booke by publique vote? how heavily brought on to judge it an agreement? how heavily brought on, to clip the power of Biſhops? how heavily brought on to vote them quite downe, although ſuch as had voted and almoſt acted downe God and all good in the Land? how much farther hath many Parliament men gone, in matters of Gods worſhip, then droven? I keepe honour in my breaſt towards them, who have done throughout truely honorably. For the execution of thorough Juſtice, are they not now by the ſword droven? and will they goe now? My heart
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:47519:105"/>
bleeds to conſider this, what a heavy ſpirit is upon us, in the proſecution of that worke which God hath thruſt us up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. Our eyes are halfe open, as heavy-headed mens eyes are, to ſee our ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages, and our handes in our boſom, like heavy ſluggards when wee ſhould take and proſecute advantages, which God wonderfully gives us. A heavy ſpirit ſpeakes heavy miſery, ſuffering much, and ſuffering long: a heavy ſpirit makes heavy miſery neceſſary; ſuch a temper otherwiſe will never go ſo far in good, as it ſhould.</p>

                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="6"/> The laſt thing which makes our ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings looke with a long viſage in my eye, is this, <hi>ſuffering doth not ſoften:</hi> our fire doth not melt, but harden and make brawny the heart of the moſt. The weekly newes of our bleeding, is become as the weekly bill of the plague, read over and throwne a ſide. Many bodies kill'd, how many ſoules more alive then were? What heart goes in ſecret, and bleeds in his brethrens wounds? Many kill'd, many more worſe then kil'd; maim'd, ſpoil'd, turn'd out of all, and likely to ſtarue to death; goe weeping,
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:47519:105"/>
wailing, and wringing their hands up and down the Country, yea up and downe here, and doe fully looke ſome of you in the face, and yet I ſee no ſigne of all this in your faces. Their tone is dolefull, doe wee eccho to them? The ſpoiled mourne to the ſaved, doe we weepe with them that weep? doe we beare their burden as our own? Let every mans con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience ſpeake, and acquit him if it can. Doth not this ſaddly ſpeak more ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, becauſe no man will ſuffer, till Juſtice bring ſuffering to his own doore? No man will be afflicted, till it come to his owne turne; no man will afflict him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, all is put upon God, he muſt doe it man by man; many will not be afflict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in few, this will be long worke. I can ſadly tell you of hearts, more braw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny then theſe: hearts that would not have ſpoiling ceaſe, becauſe it inrich<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth them: no, not killing ceaſe, becauſe 'tis their gainfull trade; that ſee bloud and deſolation dayly, and yet have no bowells, but feare this wil end too ſoon; that cut out their worke, to laſt: this is not the ſpirit of a Souldier, but the ſpirit of a Butcher, that lives by killing as his
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:47519:106"/>
Trades, and pockets up the prize of bloud and miſery, with joy. This a Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dier? a <hi>Judas,</hi> a Wolfe, that growes fat upon the carkaſſes of the ſlaine. Men that ſtrive after places, to kill bodies for gaine, Ah Lord! who hath kill'd ſuch ſoules? This is the ſpirit of a Souldier, to goe about a bleeding worke with a bleeding heart, and yet this is conſiſtent with the ſpirit of a Lyon, to a mans place: Muſt I kill bodies to ſave ſoules? O that wickedneſſe ſhould thruſt ſuch deadly worke upon me, how many ſuch Souldiers have we? if deliverance from ſuffering, come no faſter then true ſenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility under it, ſurely <hi>Englands</hi> ſufferings will be long. That ſenſibility that is, more ſelfiſh then divine. When will our troubles have an end? when this? and when that? who is that man, that lookes upon the plaiſter, as ſuited to a ſore? When will the ſore be well? whoſe heart beates thus? but every mans tone is, when wil the War end? Why? when all bad bloud is out of thy veines, will not that be long firſt? and yet wil not that be ſoon enough?</p>
               <p>Theſe things and ſuch like, make
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:47519:106"/>
me feare, Chriſtians, that your ſufferings will be long: but be not offended, we cannot be too long in the Hand of God. If long lying among the pots, bring us forth with ſilver wings at laſt, our long ſuffering will recompenſe it ſelfe: who wil then complaine that <hi>Englands</hi> ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings have beene too long? Gold ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven times purified, wil gliſter gloriouſly: thorough refining, wil make <hi>England</hi> the the glory of al Landes. If <hi>Ioſeph</hi> lye pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoner long, and be raiſed to be Prince at laſt, hath he cauſe to complaine of hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip? that his ſuffering was too long? A heart apt to take offence at Gods dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling is willing to depart; let ſuch goe, God wil have enough to doe his worke. Revolt under your long ſuffering, and your ſuffering wil be long indeed, as long as <hi>England</hi> laſts, as long as <hi>Hell</hi> laſts.</p>

               <p>Suffering is ſuffering indeed, when it goes quite through the man, body and ſpirit; body without all joy, and ſoule too.

Surely I can gueſſe your paine, you are blind: you know not who hath ſtrip't you, nor when he will returne it againe. 'Tis impoſſible for a man to joy under long ſuffering, unleſſe a man can looke to the end of it.

A man muſt looke upon affliction from one end to to'ther, that would fetch in joy to his ſoule from ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering.

you. Surely you have loſt your ſtate, and found ſinne: death has a ſting; death of a mans body, yea, and death of a mans eſtate, has a ſting. A little guilt, is heavier then a great deale of miſery, then all the afflictions of this World. When bare miſery goes over a mans head, though never ſo much, hee may well ſtand under this; but when miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry clothes it ſelfe with guilt and goes over a mans head as <hi>Iniquity,</hi> this makes the burthen too heavy to be borne: when the apprehenſion of ſinne ſtartes out of miſery, and ſtares upon the ſoule, this killes all joy dead, and the man is not able to beare up, if hee had all the World to comfort him. The cauſe may be good and the man bad; 'tis hard to keepe up a bad heart, though the ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering be good, there be ſo many by-things beſides the cauſe, breake in; guilt doth ſo ſpeake, ſtare, and teare, in ſuch a ſoule, when any bodily miſery growes great and long.

                  <pb n="208" facs="tcp:47519:114"/>Sinners tell mee what doe yee ſee? what doe yee feele? ſorrow, but no joy, why that's right: write, <hi>Lord have mercy upon mee,</hi> my hell is begun: my body is deſolate, my ſoule is deſolate, ſo 't'as been long, ſo 'twill be for ever, becauſe my miſery has not better'd me. What no enquiry? no panting for Chriſt yet? will yee rub along through one hell, till you come to another? O God! when ſhall Chriſt be in requeſt? bodies bleed, ſoules bleed, and yet is not a bleeding Saviour ſought after, that a bleeding condition may bee made bleſſed and Joyous. Sinners, you are inſnared in an evill time. Did you dreame of long ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering? what dayes are come upon you? what rack't ſoules are within you? when will this end? So 'tis, ſo it muſt be, till one deepe ſwallow up another, till the low<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt Hell ſwallow up this nether-moſt Hell.</p>
               <p>Reade my Text once more, God is to be admir'd, ſo is this point, and (I thinke) this Text to be concluded. How tender is God of the felicity of man: hee does much to deſtroy his ſinne, but no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to deſtroy his joy, when hee
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:47519:114"/>
makes him ſuffer long, he would have ſinne die, all ſinne, but no joy, no, not a dram, but riſe to an exceeding height —<hi>Rejoyce and bee exceeding glad</hi> ſaith Chriſt. All that God does, the worſt that God does to a Chriſtian, is to make him a Heaven and to encreaſe it: it ſhould make ones heart leape to thinke of it. If he caſt downe, 'tis to raiſe up; if he humble, 'tis to exalt: if he empty, 'tis to fill; if he kill, 'tis to make alive: if he make miſery long without, 'tis to make joy ſtrong within: ſtill he ha's a tender care of mans joy. This is the <hi>Benjamin,</hi> about which Gods bowells beate, let my child ſuffer any thing, but nothing in his joy. O deare father who can con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive thy bowells to thy children? Lord what is man that thou art ſo mindfull of him, and ſo tender of his joy?</p>
               <p>He that is in Heaven can ſpeake no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but Heaven: he that is never with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out joy, would never have us without joy, although we be never without ſin, no, not then when wee doe and ſuffer moſt and longeſt for him: when hee ſpeakes of long ſuffering, he ends it with
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:47519:115"/>
joy, nay, he meanes it all a long with joy. Chriſtians, admire love, God does no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to make you miſerable; all that is done this way, you doe it your ſelves. Hee has beene a Father of children, of many children, this many thouſand yeares, yet never was knowen to doe any thing, to take away the joy of any. God is very tender of your joy, be you ſo: he does nothing to kill your joy, doe not you make any thing he does, doe it. When hee makes you ſuffer much, and ſuffer long, doe not you make it kill your joy: this is to turne long ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering, into long ſinning, yet fleſh and bloud is apt to this, I'le therefore ſpeak a word to this point.</p>
               <p>Our ſufferings looke as if they would be long, they have a long viſage in my eye (as I told you laſt day:) how long ſoever they ſtretch out themſelves, yet I would have you manage them (as the holy Ghoſt here ſpeakes) with a ſpirit of joy. I will give you three or foure things to helpe, raiſe your hearts to ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer, and to ſuffer long, and all along with joy.</p>

                  <hi>'tis ſtiffnecked;</hi> hardeſt of any to returne, to be reclaimed. A mans joy commands all, and is all, and wil be all, to the heart. A man is moſt hardely brought to part with his joy. What is ſo deare to a man as his joy, let it be what it wil? 'tis his Heaven; the ſoule and Heaven are inſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parable, they are ſo identified, ſo one in another above al other things.

'Tis almoſt impoſſible to ſeparate things which are ſo neere, onely the power of a God, which can doe any thing, can doe it. Hence 'tis, that t'is ſo hard to bring a man to leave ſinne, when his ſoule hath found out joy in it, when the ſinner can make muſicke to himſelfe in his ſinnes, when the ſinner by art hath made an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrument of his ſinne, a Lute to play up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,

Bad joy, 'tis the ſoule in the armes of the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vell, hee holds faſt: 'tis the ſoule in the boſom of the devil, two evil ſpirits deare each to other, making their felicity in and of each other; evil ſpirits endear'd are harder to part then evil bodies.</p>

<pb n="246" facs="tcp:47519:133"/>
makes a thankfull man, admire much; the leaſt of Gods mercies, O how great tis, to a thankfull ſoule?

Heaven, in light: admiration (you ſee) is the naturall mother of thanksgiving, giving thanks to the Father who hath done all theſe, and theſe favours for us.</p>
               <p>Finally (for I will name no more things about the opening of this doctrin, though it were worthy long dwelling upon; thanksgiving, 'tis the proper worke of a Chriſtian, and the naturall worke of an Angel. A Chriſtian is or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ganized above all men, ſweetly to tell God, his own: he can dive deeper, aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cend higher, run faſter and further after God, then all the lower World beſide. 'Tis proper onely to a Chriſtian to ſee love, to taſte love, which are the ſtrings onely which thanksgiving makes mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſick upon; ſhee can play nothing but love leſſons. No man is divine but a Chriſtian, all others are but ſenſuall, and to be ranked with bruites in point of thanksgiving, for they give as good praiſe to God for any thing they have, as any carnall man, and better. <hi>Bruites</hi> cannot ſpeake, but their bodies really anſwer their end, which is reall thanks<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giving, for what they have and are: 'Tis a reall returne of all, for all. A car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall
<pb n="248" facs="tcp:47519:134"/>
man can ſpeake <hi>God I thanke thee, &amp;c.</hi> But neither tongue nor hand, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſoule nor body anſwer their end, and ſo man makes himſelf an Hypocrite, which a beaſt cannot do.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Waves clap their hands</hi> (ſaith the <hi>Pſalmiſt</hi>) many carnall men do not ſo much in point of thanksgiving, the beſt of them can do no more. All <hi>inanimata</hi> and meere <hi>animata,</hi> they are only Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures <hi>ad extra</hi> reſpecting thanksgiving, they can onely clap their hands, and clap their wings, and all carnall men can do no more; their Creatures onely <hi>ad extra</hi> reſpecting divine workes, what they can do at theſe is onely with their hands and with their tongues, clap their hands, clap their breaſts and lift up their eyes which ſome <hi>Bruites</hi> will be taught to doe in time.</p>
               <p>As thanksgiving is the proper worke of a Chriſtian ſo 'tis the naturall worke of an Angel, their breathing is divine prayſing: they are ſpirits of honour wait<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing upon the King of glory, their place and their ſhape is for tranſcendent me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lody: the advancing of infinite love is all their worke, they ſpeake nothing
<pb n="249" facs="tcp:47519:134"/>
elſe, doe nothing elſe, nor can doe; as the workes you doe naturally you doe neceſſarily; you breath and you can doe no otherwiſe. They are juſt under the line, love ſhines mighty hot upon them; with full face, with perpendicular rayes that they are in a continuall rapture which neceſſitates heart lifting and leap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and nothing elſe, and makes Halle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lujah's all their language. They are ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken up with returning what they heare, ſee, feele, taſte, and live in, and live up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. The reſult of all is this thanksgiving, is a divine returning of divine love: a rendring to God as wee have received as that expreſſion concerning <hi>Hezekiah</hi> is; 'tis ſaid hee rendred not, or as it is in the Originall repayed not according to what he received, which is a full and a lively definition of thanksgiving.</p>

                  </label> Lets all mourne and take on, we are all behind hand with God. The Chriſtian world is become bankrupt, quite broke, makes no returne to God of his love: he is iſſuing out proceſſe to ſieze upon body, goods, life, and will be put off no longer: bloudy Bayliffs are abroad for bad debters, all the Chriſtian world
<pb n="250" facs="tcp:47519:135"/>
over; Chriſtians are broke and make no returne, God is breaking of all. He cannot have what he would have, what he ſhould have, hee will take what hee can get; for mony he will take goods, limbs, armes, legs; hee will have his owne out of your skin, out of your bloud, out of your bodies and ſoules: he is ſetting the Chriſtian World as light and as low, as they have ſet his love. Ah Lord! what a time do we live in? Long ſuffering is at an end: mercy will be righted by Juſtice, Juſtice will have all behinde, 'twill be paid to the utmoſt farthing; 'twill ſet abroach your bloud, but 'twill have all behind. <hi>England</hi> looke to thy ſelf: how much haſt thou received? what haſt thou return'd? there is but one thing will undoe thee O <hi>England,</hi> to wit, ingratitude, not returning as thou haſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived.</p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> There be three or foure things which broadly ſpeake, <hi>Englands</hi> ingratitude. <hi>Great favours overlookt,</hi> So great things ſcarce in any age as in ours, hath God wrought, yet what impreſſion is there to be found, in any mans heart? wroks are great, and yet make but little im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion;
<pb n="251" facs="tcp:47519:135"/>
as faſt as wrought, dead; 'tis deadly ominous. Tell mee, are your hearts in a flame of love? doth Heaven ring with your praiſes? have not, doe not the dealings of God challenge this of every one? The dealings of God with <hi>England,</hi> carry a ſweete Face of love, and their inſide ſeemes very kil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling and judiciary, they leave all hearts ſo flat and ſo low, at ſuch a deſperate loſſe ſtill, as if nothing were done: the greateſt Victories, the greateſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liverances, keepe up the heart but a day, but an houre: Our favours are great, but worke not anſwerably, There is no one thing more ſad in my obſervation: they are great onely to looke upon, not great in their efficacy and power upon the ſoule, which may make you all look about you.</p>
               <p>The buddings of great deſolation appeare, <hi>The Lord pity thee England, The Lord pity thee England.</hi> Wee grow cold, under the rayes of fervent love: dead, and nothing will keepe us alive. The Revelation of great love, made us a little warme for a time, and lifted up our hearts a while, high; and now they
<pb n="252" facs="tcp:47519:136"/>
fall deadly faſt; 'tis deadly preſaging. If nothing will keepe up the heart, all wil downe, all muſt neceſſarily downe. If <hi>Ely</hi> cannot keepe up his ſpirit, hee will not keepe up his perſon: if the heart be broke and downe, the necke will be broke too ere long, and all downe: a ſinking ſpirit, preſages a ſink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſtate. Every mans heart ere while, was at his mouth leaping, now 'tis at their heeles running; love unto miracle will not keepe us alive, nor keepe up our hearts and hands, to magnifie God: what deſolating ingratitude is this? Every one lookes heavy, ſpeakes heavy, ſighes heavy, ſcarce one magnifying God. What ſhall I doe ſayes one? What ſhall I doe ſayes another? Why, what does God doe? eye him, doe your du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, follow after him with praiſe, or you will murther your ſelves and many more.</p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> A ſecond thing that ſpeakes broadly and ſadly, <hi>Englands</hi> ingratitude, is, <hi>Concuring and aſſiſting providence checkt:</hi> A willing God to doe great things for his people, ſleighted. Love workes rich<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, wee worke poorely: wee let love
<pb n="253" facs="tcp:47519:136"/>
die in travell at our doore; we are like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly then, to make a goodly returne of love, are we not? we are lazily making our ſelves ready, when love calles and puts in her finger at Key holes, and crannies, gloriouſly to us, which is groſſe ingratitude, and for which the Church was heavily judged, with a departure. We take not Chriſt by the hand, when he ſtretcheth it out to us; we doe not welcome Chriſt, as hee comes ſmiling and with a countenance like <hi>Lebanon,</hi> towards us; wee doe not bleſſe, kiſſe, and embrace him, when hee ſhewes his Face as an Angel: greater unkindneſſe and ingratitude, can there be? Wee let mercies, great mercies, melt away in their owne greaſe, and make nothing of them for Gods glory, or our owne good; as if great favours coſt GOD nothing, Gods people nothing, or were worth nothing. Heaven opens and our Eyes are ſhut: Heaven opens againe, and our Eyes are ſtill ſhut. God makes his glory paſſe by us, and we let it paſſe. Greene mercies, raw mercies, halfe mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies, baſtard bleſſings will content us, when full favours, mature favours,

admirably proffer'd.

Becauſe the man-Childe makes Panges and Throwes, therefore weary of travaile, and any peace, ſo but an end of this War; Any reformation, ſo this corporall deſola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, were but ended: O baſe <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land.</hi>

               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> A third thing that broadly ſpeakes <hi>Englands</hi> ingratitude, is this, <hi>gentle cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rections unobſerved.</hi> Who obſerves how tenderly the bloudy ſwords, is manag'd in <hi>England?</hi> How in the middeſt of Juſtice, God remembers mercy? who is taken with this? how many hearts doth this raiſe to follow God with prai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes? What an Earth-quake Juſtice makes, in the joints of the wicked! What a breſt worke in Bataile mercy makes? to ſave the innocent!

<pb n="255" facs="tcp:47519:137"/>
of bad! How hee doth droppe in reliefe like Aquavitae, when wee are ready to ſwoune, things goe ſo ill! How many hearts are taken, raiſ'd up, kept up, bleſſing God for this? Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy Exalts her ſelfe againſt Juſtice, ſhee leads and guides our bloudy Armies; Juſtice is but as a common man, wounds and killes here and there, where mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy bids it. At moſt, juſtice brings up but the reare in our Warre, ſhee comes behinde and Treades a little upon our heele, and bruiſes that, whiles ſhee breakes the heads and neckes of the wicked. O what Heavenly pillage, eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry battaile in <hi>England,</hi> hath hitherto af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forded! how much of God, how much Divine power, how much Divine wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, Divine love, to be gathered up! but who hath inricht himſelfe, with this Noble treaſure? thy greateſt mercies O <hi>England,</hi> are but ſhort liv'd: thy tendereſt mercies quickly dye, I like it not, ſhalt thou live O <hi>England?</hi> God admirably ſaves us, we wickedly kill his kindneſſe: 'twill kill us all, if not well look't to. God is full of bowells, wee are brawny, 'twill
<pb n="256" facs="tcp:47519:138"/>
not laſt ſo alwayes. God killes ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice, wee kill love what dealings are gentle, we groane under as tedious; too long, and too broad, too ſpoiling, too killing: who bleſſes God that <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lands</hi> miſeries are mild? that <hi>England</hi> is dealt with, far better then ſhee doth deſerve.</p>
               <p>I have ſpoken more generally to the Land, I will ſpeake more particularly to you Chriſtians. You have a great ſtock of love in your hand, what returne doe you make? I am commanded by this point in hand, to looke after my maſters income, his great revenue of this lower world; rent day is come, and I am come to demand it. You were Lepers, are yee cleanſed? How many returne and give thankes; you were caſt out to loathing, are yee taken into embracing? what acknowledgment doe you make? Infinite love is out upon you Chriſtians, how does it returne into the boſome from whence, it came out?</p>
               <p>Ingratitude makes great guilt, and great breach; that heart will grow too heavy for the man, that cannot be taught to praiſe God, to ſing new ſonges as
<pb n="257" facs="tcp:47519:138"/>
God renewes his favour. Three incom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parable things, are ſpoiled by ingrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude; Gods glory, mans peace, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe of grace; hee growes backward (as you have ſuch a phraſe) that is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gratefull: it turnes all mans welfare in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a conſumption: tis the thiefe that robs God and man, tis baſe baſeneſſe; Gods love and mans knit up in a Sack, and the mouth cannot be opened; all divine ſtirrings chok't, cripl'd, kill'd and deaded, which makes merrily, and ſweetly, heaven-ward. 'Twere end<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe to tell you, the evils of ingrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude.</p>
               <p>I will give you a word of remedy, and <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> ſo conclude this point. The heart is in thankefulneſſe, as tis in truth. Thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fullneſſe is the vitall breathing, of inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grity. A ſound heart arrogates nothing, but aſcribes all to God; hypocriſy is the worſt giver of all to another, that can be: truth is beſt at giving every one their owne; 'tis her greateſt paine, that ſhee can doe it leaſt, to him that is beſt to her. Integrity hath no other felicity, but to paint out love and carry it to Heaven, to ſee if God will owne any
<pb n="258" facs="tcp:47519:139"/>
art of hers, to make him glorious. All the complaint of integrity is, that favours are loſt upon her, that love dies in her boſome, and many made-priſoners by her, ſo chain'd and fettered with an evill heart, that they cannot returne to God that gave them. Integrity is ſtill ſighing and panting to get up hill, with all Gods bleſſings on her back; Oh that I could carry all ſweetely home againe, that God lends me.</p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> Secondly, as the ſoule is in life, ſo tis in thankefulneſſe; heat is beſt at making up ward. Truth is ſometimes, much ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parated from life; zeale from integrity; an honeſt heart, but ſomething cold and heavy; does not run well (I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe) in Chriſtian propriety of ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing) but we will ſuppoſe this caſe, and ſpeake on; let there be what integrity and honeſty in the heart there will be, if there be not fervent love and life, warm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>th and heat, thankeſgiving will bee poore. Thankfulneſſe comes the dead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieſt off, of any duty in a dead heart. Some birds have longer wings then o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers; they uſually flee higheſt, which have longeſt: he had neede have a large
<pb n="259" facs="tcp:47519:139"/>
ſtrong wing'd ſoule, that is good at thanksgiving, the duty is ſo meerly and ſo highly heavenly. A cold heart can doe but little at prayer, but juſt nothing at thanksgiving; you were as good goe to ſtring a ſtone and play upon it, as to make divine melody upon a ſtony cold heart. Defect in natural heat, maks benu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mednes to action, if you be benumm'd to duty, certainly there is a defect in ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall heat; you are not warme enough at heart: a man is in thankfulneſſe, as he is in ſtrength of love: ſtrong love will fall a limming out of Chriſt from head to foote acutely; his eyes are like, his haire like that, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, as the ſoule is in Prayer, ſo <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> tis in thanksgiving; as a man is in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience to the meanes, ſo he is in aſſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance to the end: as a man is at one du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, ſo he is in likelyhood and capacity to be at another. Dutys they are intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ductive, one leades into another; we goe from ſtrength to ſtrength, from the ſtrength of one duty, wee are made ſtrong to another; the bleſſing of one duty leaves ſupply behind it, to bring on another higher. God ſteps in on a
<pb n="260" facs="tcp:47519:140"/>
ſudden and lifts up the ſoule, when the man is upon his knees. A man does beyond expectation, when hee humbly caſts himſelfe upon the means; when a Chriſtian cannot doe a divine duty, let him come as neere it as he can, and God ſteps in and makes it out. When a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian cannot give thankes, let him pray, and God will turne a ſpirit of Prayer, into a ſpirit of praiſe. Some are diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courag'd from Prayer, they can give thankes no better; I come ſtill as a Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, meerely craving; why? doe ſo ſtill, tis not impoſſible to God to teach a Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven to ſing.</p>
               <p>Finally a man is at thanksgiving ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to an inward ſecret aſſiſtance and concurrence, which no man can expreſſe: as the ſpirit helps in Prayer, with ſighes and groans which cannot be expreſſed, ſo in thanksgivings, with heart-liftings, and heart-rayſing and raviſhing which cannot be expreſſed. Saylers to Heaven finde ſome times a cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent, as Saylers here below doe in ſome voyages; when the ſoule lights of this, it ſayles a pace, whether it will or no, with no paine: there are ſecret whiſpers
<pb n="261" facs="tcp:47519:140"/>
from above; bunches of the holy Land, taſtes of the powers of the World to come; theſe are above all to raiſe the ſoule, and to ſet all a prayſing God: as the ſoule is brought nearer Heaven, this duty becomes naturall. I ſee ſome very thankefull, and yet very poore, ſcarce any thing without to make Mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſick on; ſurely, they have a mighty advantage within; there is one winds up, blowes and breakes within, the inſtrument could never goe, without any thing elſe, ſo, as it ſeemes to doe.</p>

The one will reſpect the wicked, the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the godly, and ſo we ſhall carry on, what wee have to ſay. I will give you ſome principles demonſtrative of a ſtate ruined, and then of a ſtate rui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous. The firſt principle demonſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive, of a ſtate ruined is this, <hi>Not obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving eſtate:</hi> The dead heed nothing. Confuſion, is every where, and no
<pb n="275" facs="tcp:47519:147"/>
where: much and nothing; bad at any thing that is good; worſt of all, at obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving it ſelfe: can abide no where, ſtudy no where, leaſt at home. Confuſion hath eyes but none in her head, they are in her heeles, at the ends of the Earth: —<hi>Eyes, but ſee not;</hi> great parts, but of no through uſe; good parts, but had ſtill in their uſe. Let things go as they will, as they can, this is confuſions order: lets drive things as farre as they'l goe, have our will as long as we can, all goe as 'twill at laſt: that's a ruind ſoule. Proſ<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>perous things obſerve themſelves, lick themſelves, moult themſelves, caſt their feathers, pick and ſet their feathers; things that decay and die, heed noth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, neither themſelves, nor any elſe. A ruin'd Soule lets all things runne to ruine, lookes to no thing till all be loſt.</p>
               <p>Not obſerving eſtate, 2 <hi>Not caring to <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> doe it.</hi> A ruin'd ſoule is careleſſe. A man broke and undone, cares, not to caſt up acounts. A ruin'd ſoule hath no eyes, no heart to good: nothing will ſtir the dead, <hi>no eye pitied thee,</hi> ſaith God, no eye? What not the mans owne? no, there
<pb n="276" facs="tcp:47519:148"/>
are no bowels in a ruin'd ſoule, to it ſelfe. <hi>What ſhall I do to be ſaved?</hi> There is not ſuch a heart panting to be heard, in a ruind ſoule. The heart is a ſtone, the man a dead dog, a <hi>Nabal,</hi> dead alive; others muſt move for his good, hee has no heart; if <hi>David</hi> kil <hi>Nabals</hi> body, and God kill <hi>Nabals</hi> ſoule, ſo if God plague <hi>Pharaoh, Moſes</hi> muſt pray, <hi>Pharaoh</hi> can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not; if <hi>Elimas</hi> be in the gall of bitter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, <hi>Paul</hi> muſt pray, <hi>Elimas</hi> has no art, no heart to it.

                  <hi>Troubled with truth conſcience, friends which call to ſelfe obſervation.</hi> A ruin'd ſoule hath no good principle, but many bad, if theſe would mak't up: 'tis not good, 'twill not be good, 'twill not be tempted with the meanes: Chriſtians are Hypocrites; preaching, prating, foliſhneſſe; Chriſtianity, preciſeneſſe; meanes of grace kick't at, if not ſuitable to humor. Selfe-will rules every ruin'd ſoule, and yet this is very froward: fro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward wil, filthy affection, baffl'd light, fleſh leading the ſpirit; doth ſo, ſhall do ſo, till both fall into the ditch, into
<pb n="277" facs="tcp:47519:148"/>
                  <hi>Hell:</hi> Ah Lord! Now all is ruin'd in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed! Can it ever be repaired? will <hi>Hell</hi> ever give up her dead, to Heaven? A ruin'd ſtate, hath two infallible Char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, pride and malice; theſe are the two black ſpots of a deadly plague in the heart; theſe are the lungs, by which the old man breathes out it ſelfe: theſe, the poy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of the <hi>Toade,</hi> which ſpeake him in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallibly.</p>
               <p>Theſe are principles demonſtrative <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> of a ruined ſtate. I will now give you ſome principles demonſtrative, of a ſtate ruinous. <hi>All is well yet,</hi> I have many ſlips as others have; but I got up againe; fall often, but neck not broke yet; this is al the reliefe, that things are not paſt reliefe: this is a ruinous ſoule. Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence is blur'd, but the man can make a ſhift to read a little, and that little is enough: halter about's, neck, but not yet turn'd of; conſcience charges home within, but judgements yet do not ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond home without, therefore all is wel: this is a ruinous condition: houſe al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt quite downe, and the Land-Lord thinkes 'tis wel, as long as any piece of the foundation, can be found. A ruinous
<pb n="278" facs="tcp:47519:149"/>
ſtate, is not affected with it ſelfe<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but with utter ruine; if it can keepe off there, 'tis well. A ruin'd, ſoule can beare ruins, al that is dreaded is deſolation, <hi>Hell:</hi> ſurely there is much or <hi>Hell</hi> in this heart already, he doth ſo onely feare <hi>Hell,</hi> and as long as hee keepes on thus, 'twil in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe. Scratching is nothing, wound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing nothing, bleeding nothing, if it can be ſtay'd, ere all be out. All bad to day, worſe to morrow, all the reliefe that keepes up is I hope not ſtarke naught: I hope ſo too, but ſurely this is onward a pace to it.</p>

                  <hi>All will be better,</hi> though little or no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing done to better what's amiſſe: this is a ſecond principle demonſtrative, of a ſtate ruinous. A ruinous ſoule is idle: his induſtry lies in ſhifts to evade, not in care to amend. Times will turne and be better, though the heart keepe on as it was, and the man in his old pace. Something is in the view of ſenſe, and this ſtrongly cleaved to; what tender hearts feare, is but feare; he believes ſtil what is neare hand, and ſhapd by the laſie fancy: a ruin'd ſoule is ſenſuall, as long as he can ſee or feele, he is never

What a ſtate is this? can any condition come worſe then this, which this man is in? He can thinke of no bleeding, and yet his ſoule has ſcarce a drop of good bloud left; of no miſery, and yet ſcarce any can be more miſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, then hee is already; good ſtill in his own eye, and yet ſtil bad, and does nothing to amend. The puniſhment of neglect, is upon this man; when troubles were far of, hee did nothing to prepare for them, now they are neare, he is left to apprehend none; Juſtice is in this, that the man may eate the fruit of his way. A ruinous ſoule, growes ſtil more ruinous: Juſtice hides opportunites, or denies ſtirrings to take them, for abuſe of ſo many, that ſhe may take folly naked, with a ſtinging rod.</p>

                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> Creating power workes in order to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving: as a man credits Chriſt, ſo hee puts forth power to caſt out Devils; Chriſt wil have the honour of judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, ere he wil make towards a man. Judge highly and honorably of Chriſt, and he wil viſit you, and ſhew you what an arme hee hath, and how poſſible your ſtate is to him. If you judge that he can make you cleane, he wil honour your judgement and fulfill your Faith. Chriſt wil be to you in action, what you make him in apprehenſion; not a dram of your faith ſhall faile you. If you believe that he can remove moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taines, he wil do it; that he can create a new heart, hee wil do it. Your faith puts you into a capacity of a Creation, Creation puts you into a capacity of any thing; what can be wanting, to him that ſtands, under the bleſſing of a creating power?</p>

let him doe with it what he wil; that would be made happy by him. Pride is reſiſted; a pitifull condition muſt be pitifully layd open, and then bowels beate. <hi>Son of David have mercy upon me</hi> and then ſaith Chriſt <hi>what wilt thou?</hi> Any thing now.</p>
               <p>Finally creating power workes in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> to ſenſe.

Running in many channels, breakes the ſtrength and greatneſſe of a ſtreame; That love which runnes common is no thing; Love, and upon the matter, no love; 'tis conſiſtent with all miſery, both here and hereafter. Speciall love workes ſtrongly; ſhe travailes to bring forth a Heaven; a Heaven fit for man, and men fit for it; thoſe wombes which bring forth great ones, bring forth but few. Multitude is made up in magni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude; a few kinges are conſiderable, to

Chriſt alſo workes according to a proper principle in himſelfe, to wit, love; which cannot be quiet, nor leave off working, till every perſon fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowne, be fully fitted to love, and for love. Love is an untired principle in Chriſt, though not ſo in us; this makes him an <hi>everlaſting Father,</hi> a worker as a Father without ceſſation, till children be fit to be taken home, to enjoy their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heritance, fit for him who tooke ſuch a knowledge of them. Chriſt moves as an everlaſting father; he layes out, and layes out; hee's at coſt and paines this yeare, next Yeare, to give breeding,
<pb n="312" facs="tcp:47519:166"/>
high breeding ſuitable to fortune, and never leaves off, till the child be fit for his inheritance; Chriſt is an everlaſting Father, as well as a Prince of Peace; he has love, proper love in him, as well as proper duty and office devolu'd up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on him. Office bindes to finiſh for Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, love, more. I thinke 'tis proper to ſay, Chriſt moves more naturally then obligedly, to fit loſt man for his eternall home. Bonds were voluntarily taken up, and taken up from love; love is the natural motion of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> this works and never leaves working, till the ſoule upon which it ſeiſeth, be fit for Heaven.</p>

for Heaven do you ſee men make, more then they did! Hee that was filthy, is ſo ſtill: he that was an Earth-Worme, is ſo, although God be treading Wormes to death, and crumbling Earth to duſt. Though perſon and ſtate lie open to death, yet no man mends his pace for life. What ſhall I thinke of ſuch a Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration?

               <p>Sinners you heare all this, can you beare all this? do not your ſoules yet ſtir? Are they not then white to harveſt? fit to be cut off, by that ſword of wrath, which is going about? An unſtirred ſoule is fit for nothing but Juſtice; 'tis death in ſtrength upon the ſoule; 'tis the

               <p>Chriſtians, I have ſomething to ſay to you from this Point, and then I give it up, and get gon. 'Tis many a good ſoules panting often. <hi>O that J were fit For Heaven.</hi> Why? Chriſt makes ſo: He workes at ſuch a height, as at which thy heart bends. The bending of thy heart to ſuch a height in Grace, is a prevenient diſpoſition to it, 'tis the worke thou wouldeſt, begun; and well on-ward to finiſhing. Such a panting ſoule will be fit for <hi>Heaven,</hi> and caught up into <hi>Heaven,</hi> ere hee's aware. When the Soule is pitched upon ſuch a No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble height, Chriſt hath taken it into his Hand to make it ſo high. Strong deſires are glimmerings of Sunne-riſing.</p>
               <p>I would have no Soule ſad, that pants after much grace. Certainly the Sunne is riſen very high in this Soule alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, 'twill be at the Meridian apace; <hi>Heaven</hi> is not farre off that ſoule, which longs to be fit for it. When Chriſt once began to pray, <hi>Father glorify mee with thine one Selfe, with the glory which I had
<pb n="324" facs="tcp:47519:172"/>
with thee, before the World was;</hi> glory though ſo great was not farre off. When the poore man would believe, the ſpirit of Faith was neare, and the next words are Faith, and no more words of unbeliefe, <hi>If thou canſt do this, if thou canſt doe that,</hi> heard. There is no deſigne to become fit for Heaven, like bringing a mans ſoule into a paſſion this way. Divine paſſion makes ſtrong compaſſion. Chriſt does not quench ſmoaking Flax: does hee quench flam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing flax? Panting to be fit to live in Heaven, where ſo much holineſſe is, to live in the preſence of God who is all holineſſe, this is flaming Flax. The fire goes as high as Heaven: Heaven will open wide, to ſuch a Heavenly heart. The Soule would have a ſute to weare in the Country, which will ſerve at Court; a ſute on Earth, which will become it in Heaven: this is flam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Fax: Grace is never checked in its groweth by God, but embraced moſt, when it aſcends higheſt. God meetes a Prodigall, and kiſſes him: doth he not meete a deare child, which is almoſt come quite home to his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
<pb n="325" facs="tcp:47519:172"/>
Houſe, and kiſſe and feaſt him: A Soule that pants to be fit for Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, is crope up to Heaven doore, certainely CHRIST will welcome this Soule, and let him into his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire.</p>
               <p>Thou panteſt to be made fit for Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, why? thou art fit. <hi>Who [hath] made us [fit], &amp;c.</hi> Theſe are ſaid to be fit for Heaven by the Apoſtle, and yet pray'd for by him, as yet wanting much grace. There's a <hi>Fundamentall fit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, and a complementall fitneſſe</hi> for Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven. The loweſt dram of true grace, gives a fundamentall fitneſſe for Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven. A weake hand of Faith on Chriſt, will ſave a man from drowning: a ſparke of fire will aſcend to Heaven, as truely as a flame, though not ſo ſtrongly. That there is any ſparke in the ſoule to byaſſe it Heaven-ward, wee ſhould bleſſe God, and blow the ſparke by Prayer, this is the way to have more.</p>
               <p>A complementall fitneſſe is, when there is a double Teſtimony that all is ours; from Gods ſpirit, and our own: when the ſoule is ſealed with this double
<pb n="326" facs="tcp:47519:173"/>
ſeale, to the day of Redemption. When Faith is ſtrong, love ſtrong, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience much, joy much, unſpeake<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able and full of glory, then is the ſoule complementally fit <hi>(i)</hi> fully fit for glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry. This ſhould be ſtriven unto, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it makes large entrance: but the ſoule ſhould not torture it ſelfe, that it cannot with any paines, yet attaine ſo high. Some have Heaven here; ſuch are fit for Heaven in deede, as carry Heaven ſtill about with them: 'tis but out of one Heaven into another with theſe. Others are made fit for Heaven in hell, and come as out of hell to heaven, and yet this is great mercy too, and every poore low grac'd ſoule, ſhould ſay ſo.</p>
               <p>Let theſe things ſettle weake ſoules, baniſh bad objections, and make your fitneſſe for Heaven, in that meaſure which it is; your conſolation in theſe miſerable times; Swords, Guns, Wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pons of Warre, may Wound, Lame, and unfit you for Earth, but let this comfort you, you are ſtill fit for Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven.

to Heaven well enough: poore, blind, lame, halt, are moſt the gueſts that come there.

The everlaſting doores, ſtand not open everlaſtingly; But yet a great while. The Thiefe found them open, at the laſt houre of his life. A ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner may come in, at the ninth and laſt houre, and have his pay. A ſinner of a hundred yeares old, may get into Heaven, I doubt there be but few gray-headed ſinners turne in there, yet it is not long of the place. Heaven doores are open, till old Age; onely old folkes are wilfull, which is excluding. God is long ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering; all that while, Heaven doores are open. <hi>The long ſuffering of God wait<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the dayes of Noah,</hi> ſaith the Apoſtle <hi>Peter.</hi> A hundred and twenty yeares, Heaven ſtood open, to that people. God makes the greateſt mercies, waite upon the greateſt ſinners, a greate while,
<pb n="346" facs="tcp:47519:183"/>
which is one of the greateſt wonders, in the World. If you have a mind give great things, you have no mind to wait to doe it, yet ſo doth God: <hi>He waites to be gracious.</hi> The Sun is made to ſtand ſtill many houres, many dayes, many yeares. Salvation brought to mens hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, Pariſhes, yea, to mens eares, and there ſounding and knocking, ſeven yeares, ten yeares, twenty yeares: And all the intreaty is, <hi>Will yee goe to Heaven ſinners?</hi> Will yee goe to Heaven? Will you be made partakers, of the inheritance of Saints? God is not a bare giver of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, but a woer for Heaven: he does reconcile, and <hi>beſeech to reconciliation:</hi> he doth knock, and <hi>ſtand at the doore and knock, till his lockes be wet with the dew of the night:</hi> He ſtretches out his hand with Heaven in it, and doth ſo all the day long.—<hi>To Iſrael he ſaith: All the day long, have I ſtretched out mine hand, to a diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>obedient and gaineſaying People. Rom.</hi> 10.21. Heaven made to waite upon earth. baſe earth, wicked earth; what will this come to, if not looked to? If heaven not participated of at laſt? What a hell will he have, which hath had heaven

at his doore many yeares together, and had no heart to enter into it! But you will ſay, no body is ſo careleſſe: Every one ſurely, is willing to goe to Heaven. One would thinke ſo: But yet 'tis not ſo.</p>
               <p>'Tis eaſy to demonſtrate, that multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tudes have no heart to goe to Heaven. <hi>They will part with nothing for it.</hi> Sinne is worſe then nothing, and yet Sinners will not part with this, for Heaven: Have they any heart to Heaven then? Chriſt makes an underprizing of a thing, a demonſtration of no love, nor heart to that thing, ſo prized. <hi>If you thinke good give me my price, if not, forbeare: So they weighed for my price, thirty pieces. Caſt it to the Potter,</hi> ſaith God: <hi>A goodly price.</hi> Underprizing and undervaluing a thing, ſpeakes out properly and plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, no will to that thing. Will ſwayes, that way which 'tis willing. Love bids according to worth: Shee comes to Chriſts price, for Chriſt; and glad ſhee can have him ſo too. <hi>If you thinke good, give mee [my price,] &amp;c.</hi> A mans owne price, is no price: baſe bidding for Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, argues no heart to it; ſuch a wretch
<pb n="348" facs="tcp:47519:184"/>
is caſt to the Potter, caſt to hell to be torne to pieces, as a veſſell in which there is no pleaſure. If underprice argues no heart, what does no price? 'Tis many a ſinners damnable caſe, hee'le part with no ſin for Chriſt, nor Heaven, could Chriſt and hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven be much more worth then they are. Part with no ſin, doe no duty, waite no time. 'Twill be a hell to this man, to goe to Heaven. A man that will not part with his ſinnes, to be partaker of Heaven, is more willing to goe to hell then to Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven: ſinne hath got his heart, he ſhould loſe his Heaven, to goe to Heaven. A ſinners owne heaven is dearer to him, then Chriſt; he will venture the loſſe of <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> one, rather then loſe the other.</p>
               <p>They will performe no duty for Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven. Action ſpeakes out affection. To what a man hath a heart, he hath a hand, a head, a foote; heart commands all. The will is <hi>Major Generall,</hi> orders all to move as ſhe will. Where there is no foote towards Heaven, no hand towards Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, nor bending that way, Is the heart towards Heaven? From your lives, you will be condemned: yee ſpeake out your hearts, and yet you plead for them;
<pb n="349" facs="tcp:47519:184"/>
you have ſet your way you will goe, and yet upon pretend, you are bound in ſpirit for Heaven. Perverſeneſſe is in your pathes, and yet you plead for your will. Sinners obſerve that ſpeech of Chriſt. <hi>If any man [will] be my Diſciple let him denie himſelfe, and follow me.</hi> Chriſt makes deed to demonſtrate will: if a man be willing to be Chriſts compani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and ſcholler, he will follow Chriſt; yea hee will <hi>take up his Croſſe, (i)</hi> goe through any difficulty, to enjoy his fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowſhip. What <hi>will</hi> is indeed to the end, it is to the meanes. 'Tis idle talke, fancy, and dreames, not <hi>will</hi> to a thing, that will uſe no meanes. Yee tell me, yee are willing to be made partakers, of the inheritance above: what doe you doe to be made partakers? Doe you walke in the way, which leads to Heaven? Are you not in life, according to your luſts? In your courſe, according to your com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany? Unto divine duty, according to your humour? Does not will rule truth, and not truth, your will?</p>
               <p>Let perſons convinced, be inſtructed. <hi>Ye cannot be partakers of the Cup of the Lord, and of Devills,</hi> ſaith the Apoſtle: ſo ſay
<pb n="350" facs="tcp:47519:185"/>
I, ye cannot be made partakers of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, and keepe on in the way to hell, you muſt firſt be made partakers, of the <hi>Heavenly calling,</hi> as the Apoſtle calls it, ere yee can be made partakers of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven it ſelfe. <hi>Wherefore holy brethren, par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takers of the [Heavenly calling,] &amp;c. Heb.</hi> 3.1. (That is) a calling to Heavenli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe. Heaven muſt begin here; Chriſt muſt rule all, and be made all here, as he is above. A Heavenly calling, ſpeakes three things. A heavenly rule, a heavenly ſubject, and then a heavenly end. <hi>I am the way.</hi> That's a heavenly rule. <hi>Not I live, But Chriſt lives in me.</hi> That's a Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly Subject. <hi>I have fought a good fight, henceforth is laid up for mee, a Crowne of Righteouſneſſe,</hi> that's a heavenly end. The two former, are ſubordinate to this latter. Chriſt muſt be without a man, and within a man, or that man will ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver come to Heaven. He muſt be all without, and all within; he onely muſt be the way—<hi>I am the way.</hi> And he on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly muſt live in the heart, to guide this way—<hi>yet not I, but Chriſt lives in me.</hi> The Word of God and the Spirit of God, muſt meete in the life of man, or that
<pb n="351" facs="tcp:47519:185"/>
life will end in death, in hell, not in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven. A heavenly rule, and a heavenly heart, lead to Heaven. Few Chriſtians lives, are cleerely Chriſtian. Chriſt is our ſanctification, as he is our juſtifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: he is our life here, aſwell as our life hereafter: hee muſt be made ſo by every ſoule, and then all will goe well at laſt. Heaven is a Crowne of Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſſe; not of our Righteouſneſſe, but of Chriſts. His ſpirit muſt rule all, his merit muſt be leaned upon for all, this ſoule will certainly, be made partaker of all.</p>
               <p>Chriſtians ſhould be comforted from this point. All the wealth of Chriſt is communicable: Heaven communicable, communicable to you, to Saints. The complaints of Gods people are many, this point anſwers all. My loſſes are great ſayes one, ſo ſayes an other. Will not Heaven make them up? Thou haſt neither money nor goods, Thieves and Plunderers have ſtole all. Haſt thou not treaſure laid up in Heaven, where no ſpoile can be made? In caſes of perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution, Chriſt teaches us to comfort our ſelves with Heaven, how all is doubly

made up there <hi>When men perſecute and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vile you rejoyce and be exceeding glad, &amp;c.</hi> Upon what ground? Why? Upon this: <hi>great is your reward in Heaven.</hi> Loſſe hath its quantity, 'Tis <hi>great,</hi> that makes it ſo heavy; reward hath its quantity too, <hi>[Great] is your reward in Heaven.</hi> If a man had loſt a Kingdome on earth, Is not the Kingdome of Heaven reſponſible? If a man had loſt all this World, Is not the World to come, as good as this? Is not Heaven as big as Earth? As good as Earth? Aſmuch good? As laſtingly good?

the moſt immediate way of providence: heavenly favors come to us, as if they did drop out of Heaven. The more heavenly and divine, the mercies are which wee expect, in the more divine and immediate way, they'l deſcend.

               <p>Chriſtians, I would yee were skilled in the way of GOD. GOD keeps his Old way in beſtowing great things, and yet yee wonder and murmur: your folly is your owne affliction, and many's more. Things of great worth, Chriſt will truſt no Meſſenger with them, but bring them himſelfe: Chriſt will truſt none to bring your Heaven to you; neither your Heaven here, nor hereafter. Men are falſe, they would marre your heaven,
<pb n="367" facs="tcp:47519:193"/>
and bring you an old one, in ſtead of a new one, or an old one new patcht up. Bleſſed be he that will bring a new heaven to us, all new, divine favours in their maturity, though every man be trampled under foote, and none ſeene in the worke but God: though he tram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple all men in the dirt, and he onely be left alive, with the cauſe in his hand. If men would allow God his way, they would never be at a loſſe of Faith, ſo fearefully as they are. Yee open one doore and there comes in nothing but your ſhame; yee ſet open another doore of your owne, for Chriſt to come in at, and there alſo comes in nothing but your folly and ſhame. Ah Lord! When will yee looke up, and expect Chriſt from Heaven? Do not great things come in a very immediate way to man? Hath God tyed himſelfe to do every great worke, with ſuch and ſuch great meanes, as your eye is fixed upon, to caſt out a Legion of bad ſpirits, with a Legion of good? Is not one enough to do it? Chriſt brings an eternall weight of glory, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on his owne Shoulders to your doores, can he not bring a temporall weight of
<pb n="368" facs="tcp:47519:194"/>
of glory, which is far eaſier, alone? <hi>Thou art great and doſt great things, thou art God alone</hi> ſayth the Pſalmiſt. We thinke God is not God, nor able to do like a God,<note place="margin">Pſal. 86.10.</note> unleſſe ſuch and ſuch men ſtand, by him. What? Is not God, God alone? Cannot he, nay, doth not he uſe to do great things, alone? <hi>Nemine adjuvante, multis obſtantibus?</hi> Is not Heaven brought to us, againſt all the ſtrength of Hell, by Chriſt alone?</p>
               <p>I will make a more ſtrict ſoule-appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of this point. Great things come in a very immediate way: my inference is, our eyes in matters of the ſoule, which are the greateſt things, ſhould be much fixed upon God. Sinners undoe their ſoules, in that little which they doe, to ſave them. 'Tis enough to ſome, that they put themſelves upon Ordinan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, as if that were all to bring the ſoule to Heaven. Grace and ſalvation, come in a more immediate way; 'Tis not what men ſay to the eare, but what God him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe ſpeaks to the heart, which makes Heaven there, and a capacity of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven for ever. 'Tis the voice behind you that turnes you, and ſaves you. Grace
<pb n="369" facs="tcp:47519:194"/>
drops from Chriſts on we lips, <hi>[I create] the fruit of the lips, peace.</hi> Theſe waters are nothing, to him that makes them enough: 'Tis the Angels ſtirring, does the worke for Heaven. Sinners when you come to Ordinances, uſe them as Ordinances,<note n="*" place="margin">Media ut media, ſecùs ſlagella,</note> and not as Gods, charge your ſoules to hearken what God will ſay, and what God will doe. I am go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to divine Ordinances, it may be a man may ſay many good wordes to me, and God never a one, man may lift and lift, and be very lively, and God give ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver a lift, and then is my ſoule loſt: Ah Lord! How ominous is that, when God will not ſpeake a word to the ſoule?</p>
               <p>I am fallen upon a point of life &amp; death: ſinners attend, or you will utterly loſe your ſoules. You have mediate favours caſt upon you, but what immediate? You have men-preaching, but what God-preaching do you find? you keepe on in a rode-way, what foot-way hath <hi>Chriſt</hi> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in from heaven to your hearts? The Law was written with Gods own hand, and ſo diſpenſed in a very immediate way, which was <hi>Iſraells</hi> greateſt favor. Is the Law written on your hearts, by the fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
<pb n="370" facs="tcp:47519:195"/>
of God? What friends have you from Heaven viſiting you, which no eye ſees? What immediate diſpenſations from Chriſt to your ſoules? What work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of the ſpirit of God upon your ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits, doe you finde in Ordinances? ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny a man, hath no bigger favours from God, then a Horſe or a Cow; naked corporall things, for the ſupport of ſuch a corporall being; bread and fleſh, as a bruite hath hay and graſſe: This was <hi>Caines</hi> curſe; baniſhed from Heaven to earth, curſed from the preſence of the Lord, to bruites mercies, onely to what felicity the earth could afford; no fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowſhip betweene God and his ſoule. The World is full of baniſhed ſoules, from the preſence of the Lord. Juſtice for this makes no difference O <hi>England,</hi> betweene thy men and horſe, no more of one then of t'other, becauſe ſo like in qualification, one looking no higher then t'other. The nobleſt bleſſings, the greateſt favours, Heaven and Heavenly things, which God gives with his owne hands to the ſoule, theſe thy wantons and worldlings O ſenſuall <hi>England,</hi> have not eſteemed. A baſe ſunke ſpirit, hath

ſunk thee <hi>England.</hi> If thou couldeſt have but the mercies of a bruite, fat paſture and peace to graſe in it, 'twould much as thy heart wiſhes; As for thoſe greateſt favours, which God in ſtate diſpences, with his owne hand to the heart, thou haſt many children, which will diſpence with theſe, and many which will ſcoffe at them. Multitudes a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt you care not for the ſmile of a God, ſo you may have but the ſmiling countenance, of ſome great man; ſo you may but ſleepe in a whole skinne, and enjoy fleſhly delights, whether God or your ſoule ever change a good word, you heed not.</p>
               <p>Yee baſe ſpirited wretches, which care not for Heaven, ſo that yee may have but earth; know, that yee are the plague of poore <hi>England:</hi> The bloud of the Land, will be laid at your doore. Had not you growne ſo earthly and baſe in a fat Land, as to ſleight Heaven, and ſleight the greateſt favours, we had not bled at this day. Tis the badge of an <hi>Eſau</hi> to prize earth, and ſleight Heaven; to ſerve ſence, and to care for no nobler, nor nearer fellowſhip with God, then

providence bring to the belly. God may bring a Heaven to your bodies, if this will ſerve turne, and a hell to your ſoules. Let every man know the plague of his heart, and repent: carnality will kill you all.</p>
               <p>Spirituality onely covets the nobleſt things. A ſpirituall man cannot feed ſo low, nor ſo courſe, as others doe; hee muſt have a Diſh from GODS owne Table, or all dainties at his owne table relliſh not. The Creature is ſweete, but there is a Heaven beyond this, (ſaith hee.) Hee cannot ſit downe without God, nor riſe up without him. All is wanting, when God cannot be found: no body at Table, when Chriſt is not there: what dropping from Heaven upon my ſoule, from every thing? that's ſtill the Quaere, with a ſpiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all man. Immediate favours, nobleſt; God alone, all, to this man. <hi>Whom have I in Heaven but thee, whom have I in Earth, in compariſon of thee?</hi> Words of men, weighed; words of Gods with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, laid up more choyce then Jewells. The opportunity is ſtill loſt, when Chriſt and the ſoule, hath had no talke. Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nites
<pb n="373" facs="tcp:47519:196"/>
enſnare, I am too fleſhly for Chriſt to take mee by the hand, ſayes a ſpiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all man. One ſpirit is ſtill panting, after another; two ſpirits would be one in the boſome of another; no leſſe then the jewels, which hang about Chriſts owne neck, will content a noble ſpirit. The <hi>Quaere</hi> is not, how much the body hath of the Creature, but how much the ſoule doth enjoy of God. What immediate mercies, doe I enjoy? What hath God laid in, for ſpending, in theſe hard times, with his owne hands? What faith? What experiments? What divine reſolutions? Spirituality carries the ſoule ſublime; every thing is in price, as it comes from Heaven, and brings Heaven along with it. That's preaching, that brings Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven and the heart together; that's a chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian, whoſe breath ſmels like a garden, which the Lord hath bleſt; In whoſe mouth Heaven opens. As things are wrapped up in Chriſt, ſo they have their price ſtill, to a ſpiritualll man. Carnali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty makes you mind, no high things; earth is heavy; earthy ſoules cannot flee high, no higher, then the top of a golden dunghill. Let theſe things hint a bad
<pb n="374" facs="tcp:47519:197"/>
ſtate, and better it. The nobleſt things, make the nobleſt condition, both here and here after. Live low now, and live low for ever; as low as hell.</p>

A wicked man would not be where ſinne is puniſhed, nor where grace is onely practized; He is as unwilling to Heaven as to hell, yet to one he muſt.

               <p>Juſtice makes exact diſtinction. Sheep and Goates though many, yet all parted; Not a Goate upon Chriſts right hand.

goes through two hands, but the laſt gives it, its formality &amp; denomination: In us tis duty, in <hi>Chriſt</hi> tis ſanctity proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly: wee give every good thought, word, and worke, a rough ſhape, Chriſt, a full form. We mar things, Chriſt makes both them and us.</p>
               <p>If theſe things have made any diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covery, let every one call himſelfe as he is. There are but two ſorts of men with God, holy and prophane, Saints and wicked. 'Tis hard to bring men, to rank themſelves right. The worſt will not owne their condition, nor their place; no Officer of Chriſt, can make them keep rankes with evill doers, and expect their inheritance; wherefore theſe are the two things that I would a little preſſe upon ſinners. Sinners, honour truth and confeſſe your ſtate. Lay hands on a bad heart, and bring it forth to the great ſearcher of ſecrets, and charge it with its owne. My heart is wicked, my per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon abominable, my ſtate damnable. Sinners can yee thus judge your ſelves? No. Why? Then you will be judged of the Lord. What a man will not lay hands on and bring forth to God, God
<pb n="384" facs="tcp:47519:202"/>
will judge it where it lies; the ſinne you keepe cloſe, ſhall burne in your bones; <hi>David</hi> found it ſo; ſhall not a wicked man, much more? Hee that hideth his ſinne, hardens his ſoule, and hardens GOD to cut it off; hee can never proſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per. Hypocriſie diſcovered by truth, and the man not owne it? Ah Lord! Grace is fruſtrated, Juſtice onely muſt goe to worke upon this ſoule. Tis dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full to mee to thinke, what ſhuffling ſome make, to beare up before the light that condemnes them: you make a hal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter for your owne neckes in this, to be diſpatch't quickly. You fight with light, becauſe yee love darkeneſſe; what doe yee thinke will be the end of this? You make fuell for conſuming fire, to flame forth againſt you.</p>
               <p>Owne your ſtate; call evill, evill. Expect your inheritance. As a man is, ſo hee has. Dignity goes according to quality ſtill with <hi>God</hi> The wicked in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herit wrath.

fancy workes goldenly: men devoted to pleaſe themſelves, fancy befooles them, they expect nothing but brave things: but believe the holy ghoſt, <hi>an hypocrites hope will periſh.</hi> Yee unholy ſoules. What doe yee looke for now? Doe yee not frame your expectation, ſui table to your fortune? Doe yee looke for any thing now, but a ſword for your bodies, and a hell for your ſoules? This is very conſiderable, There is not any reliefe, allowed an ungodly man. Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectation is to be torture to the wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, as well as preſent dealing. Hee may not comfort himſelfe in hope, when in preſent diſtreſſe. Tell him his hope (ſaith the holy Ghoſt) <hi>ſhall be as the gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving up of the Ghoſt:</hi> as his ſtate is, ſo let his thoughts worke; let not one thought bring in reliefe to him, no, not thoſe which goe furtheſt off, and take in long<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt time to doe it; let not any thoughts, no, let not one thought, goe forth in hope to relieve this man. Expectati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is the proper reliefe of Saints, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore are they called ſo often to <hi>hope in God.</hi> Other mens hearts muſt breake, when their Eſtate breakes; their

thoughts for the future muſt be more burdenſome, then their ſtate for the preſent is miſerable, to thinke what is behinde yet: tis bad, 'twill be worſe; I am in hell, I ſhall be in another, big<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger.

There is another ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion, which by way of alluſion, to the glory of the City above is uſed. —<hi>The Lambe is the light thereof, &amp;c.</hi>
                  <pb n="399" facs="tcp:47519:209"/>
'Tis a made glory which light diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers to you here, yea, and 'tis a made light which brings in this glory to you. But what God is himſelfe, and what diſcovery hee makes of himſelfe by himſelfe, without any <hi>medium,</hi> is the glory of our felicity above. God ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to his Workes, is the glory here; God according to Himſelfe, is the glory there; his owne Face is the daily Sunne, the glorious Sunne that ſhines in Heaven—<hi>The Lambe is the light of it.</hi> The Sunne that made the Sunne, ſhines above; the ſweet that made all ſweet, is taſted on, Feaſted on alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether in Heaven. This Sunne which you behold, is but as a ſpot, or broad ble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſh, in the Face of the Creation, in compariſon of the Sunne which ſhines, in the brave World to come. This Sunne though very glorious in it ſelfe, yet very inglorious, a piece of ſtai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned paint, for feeble ſenſes to gaze at, in compariſon of that above. Some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to declare his pleaſure, rather then to make pleaſure, are all the Workes of Gods Hands here; what hee is in Himſelfe, is properly to make
<pb n="400" facs="tcp:47519:210"/>
pleaſure for the ſoule of man. All that the Lambe is in himſelfe; all that glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry and luſtre, hee hath of Himſelfe, is opened by himſelfe in Heaven. Sure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the glory of this World, is but a Dunghill to that to come: Sunne beames, but a pyramid bundle of ſtrawes.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Light is homogeneall.</hi> Every twink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling of light, is light, as every drop of Honey is Honey, and has the nature and definition of the whole: 'tis through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out, like to it ſelfe. Our felicity above is <hi>homogeneall;</hi> Heaven is all Heaven. Every corner of Heaven, is a Heaven: every thing that is taſted, a Heaven; every thing that is ſmelt, a Heaven; ever thing that is look't upon, or med<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led with, a Heaven; a full felicity to the ſoule. Our felicity here is not <hi>ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mogeneall;</hi> wee have ſome things de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightfull, more things grievous; ſome things pleaſant, more things diſplea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant. Above, all is pleaſant: GOD, pleaſant; Angells, pleaſant; Saints, pleaſant; all that all theſe ſay and doe, pleaſant.<note n="*" place="margin">On earth God is af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicting, as well as fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licitating, but in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, never ſeemingly diſpleaſed. Chriſts face is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually, as Lebanon; bright and glorious, as the looking forth of the morning.</note> No deformity above. Eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry thing in Heaven, a Heaven. <hi>GOD

As 'tis ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken of ſinne here, ſo it may be ſpoken of affliction reſpecting our Country a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove. God is felicity above, and in him, nor from him, is no infelicity, not ſo much as the leaſt affliction: God is not an afflicting God, not a chaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ening Father, in Heaven. So it may be ſaid of Saints and Angels; there is fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licity in them; and in them, nor from them no affliction, but all happineſſe. Every glote of the Eye, of every one above, pleaſant and glorious; the ſtir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring of every Finger, of every Toe, of every Haire, of every one in Heaven, a Heaven to behold. There is no diſtincti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of habit and act, time and place, meanes and end, in point of felicity, as here is; as you know there is miſery all along in the meanes (with us) and fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licity onely in the end, and that un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certaine too: and ſo a little good ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitually ſcarce any at all actually, and the like. In Heaven there is none of theſe miſerable diſtinctions, but Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven in all: in every quality, Heaven; in every action, Heaven; in every
<pb n="402" facs="tcp:47519:211"/>
time, Heaven; in every place, Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven; in every meane to ſuch an end, equally as in the end it ſelfe, Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">Simili diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſimile.</note>In things which are but like, there is ſome diſlike. Light is not univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſally permanent. Our Sunne ſets and ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, riſes and ſets, ſo 'tis with moſt parts of the World; very few parts have all day and no night; all light, and no dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe. 'Tis not ſo above, our felici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty there, is univerſally permanent: there is all day, and no night to all that upper World: the Sunne goes round that glorious Globe, without any in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpoſition to any. There is no droop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Soule in Heaven; no wounded ſpirit in all the Land above, nor ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver will. Our life above is everlaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing—<hi>Shall of the ſpirit reape life ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting, &amp;c.</hi> Saith our Apoſtle. There is ſuch inſpiration, as ſhall never ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit the leaſt expiration in any; com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts never faint, nor flat; no ſoule growes weary of place, company, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bit, dyet, imployment: every ones Heaven, is an eternall Heaven; every ones reſt an eternall reſt. Some have
<pb n="403" facs="tcp:47519:211"/>
beene in Heaven many thouſands of yeares, and yet not a thought of diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like of any thing there, nor the leaſt deſire ſtirring to be any where elſe, but the ſtrong deſire of all, that all Gods deare ones were there. The ſpirit and the Bride ſay, come. Chriſt and all thoſe members hee has above, pant for the reſt, that all were as they are; <hi>one, as they are one.</hi> Joy is made as vaſt as the ſoule, as laſting as the ſoule, and the ſoule as laſting as Chriſt. There are no broken Ciſternes above; not one Veſſell drops out one droppe of its felicity, in the ſpace of eternitie, though hee ſtand brim full. No con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumption, no Diſeaſe above; every thing lives, yea, and thrives for ever. There is <hi>eternall Revelation,</hi> in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven: Infinite excellency, taking ſui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table time, to lay open it ſelfe, to all others: there's <hi>Johns</hi> rapture to all eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie.</p>
               <p>All theſe particulars gathered up render the meaning of the Metaphor to be this, That our felicity above, is a full and abſolute felicity; a tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcendent bleſſedneſſe, ſuiting ſuch
<pb n="404" facs="tcp:47519:212"/>
a tranſcendent being as the ſoule of man is.<label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Ʋſe. </seg>
                  </label> Now my queſtion to you all, is, what labouring for abſolute felicity? for bleſſedneſſe to ſuite your ſoules for ever? 'Tis the judgement that lies hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vy, upon the ſoules of moſt men, they ſeeke not after full mercies, a perfect bleſſedneſſe. Feele your Pulſe: tell mee how your hearts beate: how nim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble doe they worke out after Earth? How ſlow after Heaven? I looke up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on ſome men's Lives, and my heart trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles to thinke what will become of their ſoules; al the care is for the body: how does Trading goe on? How does money come in? When is the Queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on? How will't goe with my ſoule for ever? What bleſſedneſſe is provided for my ſoule, to inherite? Are your bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies everlaſting? Is this World ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting? Can any thing but Heaven make an abſolute felicitie for you? Are not your ſoules everlaſting? Can any thing leſſe then Heaven, make a ſuitable felcity for them?</p>
               <p>Pravity is miſleading, but when the Soule is judged for this, there is noe tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the man; this conſideration makes
<pb n="405" facs="tcp:47519:212"/>
mee ſhake indeede, when I conſider how Earthy ſome men are, and how wilfull in their way. Speake to them of minding their Soules, and beating off their thoughts from this VVorld, you are as Vinegar to their Teeth, and ſmoake to their Eyes. When corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion thrives in the ſoule, 'tis danger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous; but when it has got a head, Ah Lord! The ſtate of that man is deſperate. Who ſhal ſave that man from Hell, and bring him to Heaven, which is earthy, and wil be ſo ſtill?</p>
               <p>The Creature is ſeducing: much is promiſed, but its ſtill a lie to the ſoule; the fulneſſe of the World, makes up no fulneſſe to that noble part with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in. If there bee any abſoluteneſſe in things here below, 'tis in point of vanity; they are <hi>Vanitie of vantie, and vexation of ſpirit (i)</hi> Perfect vanitie, <hi>juſt nothing,</hi> as our Engliſh phraſe is. Conſider all the Word in reference to the ſpirit, and tis a heape of perplexi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, A Buſh of Briers and Thornes: ſhall all your induſtry lie, to Crowne your ſoules with Thornes? With our Saviours Croſſe and Curſe? Are you
<pb n="406" facs="tcp:47519:213"/>
not ſcratcht enough with the World yet? Will not your ſpirits be vext e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough hereafter, but will you be vex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of them here too? Will you begin your <hi>Hell</hi> in Earth, and inure your ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits, to tearing and torment before the time?</p>
               <p>Know your ſoules, and what is the felicitie of them, and what you doe, do in good earneſt to attaine it: you move as you love, Chriſt concluded that, when the Jewiſh Church ſleighted him. If you love darkeneſſe better then light, you will never ſeeke out for light nor for that Inheritance which h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>s there. If Heaven were more abſolute felicitie, or more tranſcendent bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſedneſſes then 'tis, a heart pre-en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged <hi>(i)</hi> ſet upon an other Heaven, will ſleight Heaven indeede: your life lies upon this poynt, to looke how, and where your love is picht; where a mans Treaſure is, there will his Heart bee; if you make money onely your Treaſure, you will onely bend in good earneſt after it. If you make not Heaven your chiefe Treaſure, you will not ſeeke after it heartilie.
<pb n="407" facs="tcp:47519:213"/>
Heaven has beene ſhadowed out to you, according to the Metaphor in the Text, is it now of any price in your Eye? Has it gained your love? 'Tis a tranſcendent bleſſedneſſe: are your hearts taken with it, as ſuch a bleſſed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe? Till this, I ſhall not looke to prevaile with any ſoule, to ſeeke out after Heaven, to any purpoſe. 'Twas the Art that Chriſt uſed, when hee ſpake of eternall things, firſt to ſet out the excellency of them, to make that ſparkle gloriouſly in the Eye, to ſtirre love, and then anſwerablie come on to doe good. <hi>J am the Bread which came downe from Heaven, &amp;c. — J am the Bread of Life, &amp;c.—And hee that ſhall drinke of the Water that I ſhall give him, ſhall never thi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

An love bee as it was, the man will be as hee was; if Heaven be at his doore, hee will ſtep be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide it into <hi>Hell.</hi> Divine Love is that flame, that carries the ſoule upward, where this is not, Heaven though all, is nothing.</p>

If your love to ſinne live, you will have your pleaſure in it, though you die for it. If love to ſinne live, there is but one way with your ſoules; they will die in that ſinne. Love of ſinne, and Heaven opened to the ſoule, 'tis rejection of Chriſt, with his greateſt bleſſing in his Hand. Chriſt caſts off every Soule, that thus deſperately caſts off him. <hi>A Man muſt ſet his Knife to the</hi> Throate of an Iſaack, Judge his Soule in that which is deareſt, if ſinne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full: GOD will not elſe looke to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards a Man, with great things. <hi>Hee looketh upon Men, if any ſay I have ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, and perverted that which was right, and it profited mee not, hee will de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver

               <p>Conſolation muſt conclude this poynt. Chriſtians I am to give you a glad word, in this ſad Time. Your Inheritance here is ſpoyled, you have one that lies above ſpoyle, <hi>in light.</hi> Can Men or Devils pull the Sunne out of Heaven? Then may your higheſt fortune bee ſpoyled. You have one Sunne turned into blood, but you have another which cannot. Your fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licitie here is broken, and growes e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very Day more broken and bloudy: you have a felicitie compleate, full, abſolute, as full of Bleſſedneſſe as the Sunne of light, a felicitie as full of Beames, as the Eyes of the Soule can receive. Draw up your ſoules to Heaven quicklie, Earth is poſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing away: Let good bloud ſtirre, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very drop will bee loſt elſe.

There is death, and the ſhadow of it, before it come. So there is life, and the ſhadow of it: light is here made the ſhadow and ſemblance of Heaven, of a glorious eſtate to come. As there be <hi>Taſts of the World to come;</hi> ſo there be ſights: Light gives glimp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes below, of the glory that is above. There is a beholding <hi>the Land that is far off; the Face of Chriſt, in a Glaſſe; the</hi>
                     <pb n="411" facs="tcp:47519:215"/>
glory above, by the glory here; one Heaven, in another; Heaven, in Light. Man hath many Sermons preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to him, to make him Heavenly, as many Heavenly Sermons, as there be rayes in the Sunne: by every glimpſe of Light, you ſhould ſet before you Heaven. As long as the Sunne ſhines, you ſhould not want a Sermon, to ſend your ſoules to Heaven.</p>
                  <p>God deales, with fleſh, as fleſh. Man is a Creature taken with ſhadowes. Things drawne out to the life, take. The Soule now, fetches in all from ſenſe; God ſtoops to helpe in things this way, at ſuch doores as they will goe in at. GOD wraps up the higher Heaven in the lower; glory, in Light, and ſo brings it downe to carnall ſenſe, and enobles it there, to enoble it with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in; catches the ſenſes, to catch the Heart, and ſave the Soule. If Light be ſo glorious, what is Heaven! This is the ſecret Soule-taking argument, that is wrapt up in this Metaphor. Though your bodies have yet no Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven: your ſoules, if you walke as you ſhould, neede never be without one.
<pb n="412" facs="tcp:47519:216"/>
As long as your Eyes bee open to ſee the Sunne, you may ſweetely ſend your Soules to Heaven. Some ſweare by the Light; this is to ſend their ſoules to <hi>Hell,</hi> not to <hi>Heaven,</hi> by the Light.</p>
                  <p>God moves in meanes powerfully. Pictures are powerfull, upon fleſh and bloud. Make things glitter, and Man will gaze: make Earth glitter, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though ſo baſe, and fallen Man will be taken with it; worke it up from its baſeneſſes but ſo little, as to looke gol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den and glorious, and man will dote upon it. How taking is golden Earth, to al the World! Heaven is wrapt up in Sun-beams and made to glitter, to catch a foole. Chriſt is expreſſed by the Sunne; Heaven, by Light, that if ſenſe have any power upon the ſoule, no ſoule may goe to <hi>Hell,</hi> whileſt the Sunne gives Light.</p>
                  <p>There were tranſient Viſions; now there are ſtanding. Truth and the Creature, are Gods ſtanding Viſion. Things below are all made at Divine pleaſure, to ſpeake out things above. The Word of God uſes the Workes
<pb n="413" facs="tcp:47519:216"/>
of GOD, to ſhadow out what cannot bee plainely ſeene here: inviſible things, are brought to underſtanding, by viſible; Heaven, by light; <hi>Hell,</hi> by darkeneſſe: <hi>Hell</hi> beneath, by <hi>Hell</hi> here. The gnawing Worme is uſed, to ſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow out gnawing conſcience; gnaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing conſcience, to ſhadow out <hi>Hell.</hi> Man hath his viſion, what ſhall bee, in things round about him.

All runs into this, CHRIST makes lively apparition of things to come.</p>
